I got my computer back and it was in fact a hardrive issue. It was just a coincidence that I was running an extensive Webots  simulation

Thanks for the tips

##### Marian 06/30/2020 09:45:52
Ok, thanks a lot for the explanation. It works!

##### lojik 06/30/2020 09:32:56
Your "shape" node should be in the "children" one and not "boundingObject". Then you can select it in "boundingObject" because bounding object is just the virtual shape taken into account when performing contact simulation. It is not the visual rendering of the object.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/25/2020 04:55:19
About your other question, was your controller writing to a file? Would it be possibl that it saturated the hard drive?


You can do this directly from the proto itself, you simply have to set the 'randomSeed' field to 0 as explained here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-floors#uneventerrain-field-summary](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-floors#uneventerrain-field-summary)

> `@Clara Cardoso Ferreira` to reset the terrain from the proto file is indeed possible, unfortunately it is not possible to move the robot from there, but you can move it then at the first step of the simulation with a Supervisor controller.

`@David Mansolino` 



Your answer somewhat helps. I understand I can reset the terrain, but would I have to reset it manually or is there a way to make a loop so that a different terrain is used in every simulation iteration? I imagine I would have to connect the supervisor code to the proto somehow



Another big question, I forgot a simulation running overnight on my computer and the next morning, it would not turn on. It may have been a coincidence that my computer failed even though it is under a year of use. Would you have any suggestions of what may have gone wrong?

Yes, that sounds good.

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/24/2020 14:04:12
ok i see, so I am looking for points that they have a certain value on y axis > 0.1 for example ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/24/2020 14:02:59
That's unfortunately not so simple, the number of contact points of the wheel can vary, you should rather check the location of the contact points.

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/24/2020 14:01:48
ok so if I have a pioneer 3dx robot the default contact points are 3 , these that the wheels have with the floor and if I detect 4 or more points I can assume this is a colision right ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/24/2020 14:00:20
Yes, you can get the number and location of the contact points of a node:  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_contact_point)

> Also, what is the benefit of using the supervisor vs a sensor (like the GPS) to get states such as position?

`@Clara Cardoso Ferreira` no benefit, if you are trying to get your own position, GPS is the way to go, if you are trying to get the position of another node supervisor is the way to go.


> Does anyone know if it's possible to reset the terrain in the proto for every simulation and set up the robot's wheels to touch the ground to start the simulation?

`@Clara Cardoso Ferreira` to reset the terrain from the proto file is indeed possible, unfortunately it is not possible to move the robot from there, but you can move it then at the first step of the simulation with a Supervisor controller.


> Can somebody help me to figure out how to reset the simulation without having to stop the controller, actually I want every time a condition is true in the controller to reset the robots initial position only, not the simulation time

`@black_hammer_67` yes, you can use the `wb_supervisor_simulation_reset` Supervisor function: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=c++#wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_reset](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=c++#wb_supervisor_simulation_reset)

##### Andrei 06/23/2020 23:34:32
I guess it depends what you want to do. I wanna make a pathfinder so I wanna know the whole map when I determine the path I take not just what sensors can give me.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 15:38:09
You can simply write a supervisor controller that will move the robot to a random position at the beginning of the simulation.

##### lojik 06/11/2020 12:29:35
Okay, thank's 👍

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 12:01:48
Uneven terrai is using an EleveationGrid as mesh, this mesh is way more stable/efficient than IndexedFaceSet for collision but has more constraints ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid))

##### lojik 06/11/2020 12:00:12
I also see that uneven terrain seems to use a symetric grid mesh as a bounding object, is it right?


Yes, exactly, you use quite the same idea behind the road PROTO. So I will keep in mind this way to create meshes. Thank you !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 11:51:11
OK, it make sense, for we are using similar meshes to create roads and it works quite well. Note that you might be interested by the road PROTO as it allows to create similar meshes (when varying the height of the road): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-road](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-road)

##### lojik 06/11/2020 11:48:58
Ok thank you, so my intuition is not right, but it works much better with this mesh 👍

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 11:45:25
The mesh looks indeed to be very clean like this. Just for the note, for the cylinder, the parallel lines are just for visualization, for the physics it is a perfect cylinder.

##### lojik 06/11/2020 10:34:08
PS: The first run after importing such an object will provoc a webots' crash.

Ok, so after playing a bit with my meshes I have a first intuition. I realize that your cylinders are composed with only parallel lines. So I did the same in blender for my sinusoid ground and it seems to work much better. Now it is detected every time instead of 1/3 run.



Unfortunately it will keep to have triangles by exportations. But since there is a huge number of parallels in  my mesh, it works fine now.



I do not know if I explain well enough .. Here is my final mesh :

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:03:22
You're welcome

##### lojik 06/11/2020 09:02:53
Ok, well, I did not expected that. I have some good results with my meshes. But from one simulation to an other one the results are not the same so I was wondering where it was wrong.



Thank you for your answer, I will have a deeper look to find a good solution between approximation geometries and find a good mesh.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:00:04
> I will always have to approximate the bounding object with a circle

Not exaclty, you can use several geometries to approximate the shape (such as for example several circles to approximate an ellipsoid).

##### lojik 06/11/2020 08:58:23
If I understand correctly it is actually not possible to create more complexe shapes with their own bounding object? If I would like to have a ramp which look like an ellipsoid more than a circle. I will always have to approximate the bounding object with a circle or take time too find a good threshold with the mesh to make it works?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 08:51:10
I am sorry but there is no magic solution for this, using meshes as bounding object is not the ideal solution.

##### lojik 06/11/2020 08:48:00
I already have a basicTimeStep set to 1ms 😅


I work with blender to do these meshes. My goal is to have well designed unflat terrain to benchmark my robot in that condition.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 08:46:16
it all depends on the complexity of the mesh, but there is a tradeoff (which is not always easy to find).

But maybe a simpler solution for recording the video is to decrease the WeorldInfo.timestep.

##### lojik 06/11/2020 08:46:02
Because I would like to import custom models to have more freedom on the form of obstacles I have. It would not be a good deal if I have to redo the bounding object after importing them..


Would it be better if I have a finner mesh? Or worst?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 08:44:01
This is because the bounding object created automatically when imported are based on the actual mesh, this is known to be not very accurate and stable, for better collisions, you should re-create the key bounding objects using sets of basic geometries (e.g. boxes, spheres, etc.)

##### lojik 06/11/2020 08:42:15
I just try now to begin recording the video after that the robot well detected my objects. In that case it works fine, but I have to play simulation until the robot detects my objects and then begin to record video.


And this effect is worst when I would like to record a video. The object are never well detected.


As seen on this picture, the wheel on the left is inside the object and the bounding object (in white) should be in red if it is well detected by the wheel.



On the right, the wheel is correctly on top of the object.

Hi `@David Mansolino` sorry, I did not explain well...  My problem is that I actually use the objects shown in the previous picture. With the bounding object as their own shape. But when my robot has to climb them, sometimes the wheel go through the object instead of climb it. It seems that the bounding object is not here.



I actually use webots nightls R2020b 9\_6\_2020

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 04:57:15
Hi `@lojik` what is exactly the problem you have with the bounding object,?We can't see them on this picture.

##### lojik 06/10/2020 16:48:44
Here you have the kind of objects I imported. These are kind of sinus waves. I put a bit of each pieces down the floor to have smaller mountains.

Hello there, I imported a 3d object in webots by using webots 2020b. It happen frequently that an object is suddently not takent into account with contacts. It seems that there is some problems with the bounding object.



Could it be a bug on this nightly version or is it a problem on my side?

For the whole moon, it is indeed going to be slow, but if you import only a reasonable sub-section, the performance should be ok. See this example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/ch-vens](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/ch-vens)

so that my robot can learn how to navigate in unknown terrain


I could import the whole moon, but I plan to have at least sections of the moon


For my case, it changes every meter. I am trying to import the map of the moon to Webots

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/29/2020 05:03:20
Will the terrain change at each step ?

##### Iguins 05/28/2020 22:10:01
I was facing that same problem

My guess would be that his solution would work, but it would probably be extremely slow since you would have to generate each individual slide of the terrain at every render pass


> One possible solution would be to create a procedural PROTO ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)) which will read the float image and generate an ElevationGrid ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid)) from it.

##### AngelAyala 05/28/2020 06:54:54
I wasn't considering as real context, thanks


ok I get it, both running in different controllers

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/28/2020 06:53:39
What you can do is to send the GPS data from the Mavic2Pro controller to the supervisor controller using for example the Emitter/Receiver devices


This is like in real context.


if yes, then you cannot read the Mavic2Pro GPS device values from another robot/supervisor.

##### AngelAyala 05/28/2020 06:52:31
yes

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/28/2020 06:52:23
Is the Supervisor controller different from the Mavic2Pro controller?

##### AngelAyala 05/28/2020 06:51:35
using python


is there anyway to do this?


now, how can I access to the GPS node inside the Mavic2Pro PROTO using the supervisor node?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/28/2020 06:20:00
but you can simply check the return value


this s indeed just a warning which doesnt  raise any exception

##### AngelAyala 05/28/2020 06:19:11
is maybe a especial ExceptionError?


I'm currently using, but when appears this error Error: wb\_gps\_enable(): invalid device tag, the code is unable to catch it

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/28/2020 06:18:04
you can always use a  `try` and `except` on the sensitive part

##### AngelAyala 05/28/2020 06:15:18

This is not possible.

##### Sanket Khadse 05/22/2020 15:45:40
So could you tell me how can I make this static scene to moving? (by using my controller code of course).

No, as I said, its none of these two cases.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 15:41:18
Exporting a to HTML will simply export a static scene (no motion), so you probably want to either export an animation or stream a live simulation?

##### Sanket Khadse 05/22/2020 15:37:09
Yes, I have already read it. I need to simulate my world on a web browser using HTML file. I mean anyone with the file can open the simulation on the web. Server streaming or already recorded animation isn't the case.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 15:32:27
Please refer to the user guide: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-interface](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/web-interface)


Do you want to export an animation or to stream a live simulation?


That's because you exported to HTML but you are not streaming the simulation.

##### Sanket Khadse 05/22/2020 15:28:54
`@Olivier Michel` you see, no other option or window opens. neither the drone moves. But in webots, it moves. Any suggestions?

There is no controller for lock position of the DJI Mavic 2 Pro

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/15/2020 04:57:11
`@Sanket Khadse` the controller of the drone is very simple, it doesn't do any feedback using the GPS position or any inertial unit, it might therefore easily drift.


`@Jesusmd` you want to get the type of distance sensor? If so you should use the ``getType`` function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor?tab-language=python#wb\_distance\_sensor\_get\_type](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor?tab-language=python#wb_distance_sensor_get_type)

##### Sanket Khadse 05/15/2020 03:02:49
Hey, may I know, why does a drone, (let it be DJI Mavic 2 Pro, which is already available into Webots, or a custom made) moves up and down and shifts constantly in one direction even if no such behaviour is defined in the controller code?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/14/2020 05:34:23
`@Luftwaffel` instead of relying on ROS, if you are using Python you ca probably use the `transforms3d` python package which allows for example to convert from a rotation matrix to quaternions: [https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/reference/transforms3d.quaternions.html#transforms3d.quaternions.mat2quat](https://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/reference/transforms3d.quaternions.html#transforms3d.quaternions.mat2quat)

I'll give it a try

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 16:18:13
If you use Webots with ROS, you need to install ROS, and you should get 'tf' for free, isn't it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 16:13:18
OK, so you need to convert this 3x3 rotation matrix to a quaternion then.


Yes, you are right. Sorry, my bad.

##### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 16:12:12
but that returns the 3x3 matrix

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 16:11:40
If you need absolute rotation (in axis-angle notation), use:  [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation)


(gives relative rotation in axis-angle notation)

##### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 16:09:36
how do we get axis angles? I have the 3x3 matrix

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 16:09:02
```python
def axis_angle_to_quaternion(axis, theta):
    axis = numpy.array(axis) / numpy.linalg.norm(axis)
    return numpy.append([numpy.cos(theta/2)], numpy.sin(theta/2) * axis)
```


No, you have to get it as an axis-angle representation, but that's super easy to translate into quaternion.

##### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 16:04:22
Btw, is there a way to get the quaternion orientation directly from webots? That would make things much simpler


Still a bit crude with little error correction, but it works 🙂

The problem is, it is considering each part of the hinge, like screws, doors as separate individual. (As in the scene tree, it is showing each part differently with same name - "transform") 

Neither it is considered as other objects in the world's, because while I tried to click on the hinge, it won't click and show it's origin and all.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/09/2020 12:38:42
About the second issue, I would use the Supervisor API to move the whole mast: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)


About the first issue, you mean you don't now how to make the radar moving ?

##### Sanket Khadse 04/09/2020 12:35:55
Hey, I want to use a ship mast in my simulation,  which basically has a tower like structure and a radar (dish),  which continuously moves around in a 90° angle.  

So the problem is,  I dont know how to make the part moving in the manner I need.  

There's another interesting problem,  that the whole mast should move in a sinusoidal manner (basically, the way it moves in the sea). How could these things be done?! 

Thank you!

Hi yes of course, in Webots you can use the regular Webots API to control the simulated robot, you will find some example controllers here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers)

In Python I personnally often use the ``transforms3d``module (available on PIP: [https://pypi.org/project/transforms3d](https://pypi.org/project/transforms3d)) which allows to convert between many 3D representations, you will probably find what you need in the doc: [http://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/](http://matthew-brett.github.io/transforms3d/)

I have been using python 3..

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/25/2020 12:31:30
Hi `@mint` unfortunately, Webots API does not provide such function. But I am sure you can find plenty of external libraries that do this. Which language are you using ?

##### mint 03/25/2020 12:29:59
Oh, its setVelocity function at supervisor


Hello, I have been develping with webot and encountered a issue with setVelocity function for a node  in supervisor. The setVelocity function takes the angular velocity in form of rotation aroud respective x y z rotation, but my calculation for angular velocity would give the result in form of axis-angle (normal vector and the magnitude of rotation around it). I'm now troubled with converting w in axis-angle form to the x y z rotation form. Is there any formula, functions or library supported by webot?

##### Jesusmd 03/23/2020 08:50:34
`@David Mansolino`  ho my fault, I see it is points.x or some other proprieties, thanks!


`@David Mansolino`  the loop is correct but for some reason my x,y and z values give 0,  I tried something like this : Lidar\_h\_r = Lidar1.getHorizontalResolution()

    print("the getHorizontalResolution is:", Lidar\_h\_r)

    Layer = Lidar1.getNumberOfLayers()

    Layer\_id = Lidar1.getLayerPointCloud(Layer)

    for i in range(Lidar\_h\_r):

        Point = Layer\_id[i]

        print("point:",Point.z,Point.y,Point.z)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/23/2020 07:37:30
In that case you should be able to make a loop and modify the LidarPoint objects, somthing like (untested):

```Python
for point in lidar.getPointCloud():
    # do something with the point
```

##### Jesusmd 03/23/2020 07:34:28

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/23/2020 06:19:27
HI `@Jesusmd` which lanugag are you using?

Why do you want to change the properties of the lidar points? These value should be seen are readonly value as they represent the measure of the sensor.

##### Jesusmd 03/23/2020 04:32:31
Hi, I need to read the LidarPoint properties with the CluodPointEnable, but I just have one list of object pointers, so my questions is how I can set all properties with LidarPoint class imported? I mean set all values of each point into a object made by LidarPoint class.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/18/2020 10:56:25
HI `@taeyoung`, this is unfortunately not possible out of the box, however, the solution is to use the Supervisor API, using the supervisor API you can at each step monitor the position of the ball and move the light accordingly.

Here is an example where a Supervisor moves a light at a predefined location: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)

for vehicle and ROS, there is a specific controller making the bridge between Webots and ROS1 it should work out of the box: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros\_automobile](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros_automobile)

If you have issue recompiling Webots, here is the guide: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation)

(It should work for Ubuntu 16.04 as I am using it on a daily basis)

##### KyleM 02/28/2020 23:53:37
I had comment most of the child make(s) and just compile the vehicles folder


Was able to solve my own problem by running 'make' on the main /projects folder. It doesn't build cleanly on 16.04 Ubuntu by the way


Is there any documentation or projects I can study to figure how to control my robot my ros?


However...I can't figure out how to compile the ros\_automotive to connect it my some ros nodes


I built a custom Car PROTO and I can drive it around with a python controller using the Driver class

All these benchmarks are also included in Webots in the Webots/projects/samples/robotbenchmark folder.


I would recommend you to visit [https://robotbenchmark.net](https://robotbenchmark.net) for a series of Python-based robotics challenges that may involve reinforcement learning.


Hi `@cnaz`, I would recommend you to start with simple Python controllers (see for example Webots/projects/languages/python/worlds/), define a task to be learnt by the robot and use reinforcement learning techniques in your Python controller.

##### cnaz 02/25/2020 08:36:14

##### rbhuva 02/24/2020 15:14:52
can any one help me to achieve this...


In my project, I would be changing the number of light sources considering them as a food source for the robot (treated like animals). The hypothesis of doing so is to observe the behaviour of an individual animal and swarm of the animals when they have different food sources available at different locations. Moreover, it is also assumed that it is possible to simulate the behaviour of the animals towards the food origin of different quality. That is, they might turn to the light(food) source of the higher intensity even though the less intense light source is nearer to them

To carry out these experiments, I will consider the intensity of the sources, number of sources, number of vehicles as my independent variables.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/21/2020 10:07:30
Yes, that's a very good idea as well.

##### Axel M 02/21/2020 09:51:54
Thats great, in the meantime I was considering modifying urdf2webots in order to generate PROTO files containing only the IndexedFaceSet of the parsed mesh (that's what i've done manually on my model). In the light of the above issue, does that seems still relevant to you ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/21/2020 09:47:26
See [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1396](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1396)


Regarding point 2 (large meshes), we are considering implementing support for meshes in Webots in different formats (DAE, OBJ, STL) by introducing a new node called Mesh that would replace the IndexedFaceSet node by referring to a mesh file (DAE, OBJ, STL, etc.) instead of listing a large number of coordinates and coordinate indices. I will open an issue about it to explain our design ideas. You are very welcome to contribute by proposing an implementation.

##### Axel M 02/21/2020 09:28:05
Some issue I ran into when using urdf2webots:

- The resulting model in webots is laying on its right side (-90 deg roll). This seems to be related to axes differences between ROS (Z upward) and webots (Y upward)

- Large meshes are merged into a single PROTO file, which results in a (very) big file not suited to manual modifications in a text editor



I'm eager help on those issues

Yes, here it is:

##### machinekoder 01/23/2020 10:58:35
`@Fabien Rohrer` Thanks, I'll try that. Is the PR2 model in the examples?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/23/2020 10:50:34
In such case, you can master the grasping force precisely, and that matters 🙂


The most important thing was to control the gripper in force control rather than in position control.


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm0FhXAxkXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm0FhXAxkXg)


I had similar issues for the PR2 simulation.


I think you need to actuate the Webots joints of the underactuated joints, yes.

##### machinekoder 01/23/2020 10:14:42
[https://youtu.be/240b1ubUwMA](https://youtu.be/240b1ubUwMA)


Not really. The example grippers seem to have actuated joints. However, the ezgripper has two under-actuated joints, meaning they are not driven by a motor. What's the best way to simulate this behavior. Or shall I just actuate them in the sim? I tried to mimic the real behavior using touch sensors, but my approach wasn't successful.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/23/2020 10:08:29
Does this answer your question?


Other solutions looks like hacks to me.


This is certainly the best way to implement this.


Generally all our grippers have physics, collision  shapes and joints.


Hi,

##### machinekoder 01/23/2020 10:05:11
I have acquired an EZgripper ([https://sakerobotics.com/](https://sakerobotics.com/)) for my robot. What's the best way to simulate such an under actuated gripper? I've written a small Python controller, but I can't really make it grasp properly. Any ideas? I don't really need the physics aspect of the grasping itself, just being able to move objects around.

Apologies for the continuous questions - lines here have broken down and unable to download just yet. Is there a drag and drop interface for simple movement design? Thanks

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/16/2020 06:52:50
You're welcome

Using the safe mode might help: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)


`@rbhuva`, what is exactly the error you get?

PLease make sure to update the driver of your GPU.

##### rbhuva 01/15/2020 23:33:21
sorry guys I am asking very silly question but I am stuck

I downloaded and try various versions of the Webot software but after installing it always shows the error of unexpected stop working webots on windows. I need the software please give some solution.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 06:54:13
`@rbhuva`, no we are using the Webots simulation environment 😉

##### rbhuva 01/15/2020 02:09:57
anyone has Breve Simulation Environment?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 07:32:26
`@Shanaka` instead of using motion file you should control directly the motor individually  (in speed, position or torque/force) using the motor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions)

You can easily get the name of the individual motors by double-clicking on the robot to open the robot-window.

IF you didn't already did, I strongly recommend to follow our tutorial (which explains how to control the motors individually): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

##### Shanaka 01/02/2020 08:15:57
I'm shanaka currently working as a research engineer in the department of electrical and electronic engineering, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. These days, I engaged to design simulation using PUMA 560 robot manipulator in WEBOT and note that I'm very new to webot. 



I modified the end-tool of the manipulator by replacing the Pioneer gripper



I  control this entire manipulator (with new gripper) by modifying puma560.motion file and puma560.c file. 



But I need to add dynamics and individual joint controllers to this simulation with the idea of implementation in real world. So i check puma560.c file and there I found  functions called 



wbu\_motion\_new("puma560\_1.motion");

wbu\_motion\_play(motion);

but I was not able to find the definition of these functions anywhere. ( I checked motion.h Motion.hpp Motion.cpp files.) Although I can find the function definitions inside the above-mentioned files, still I was not able to find function definitions and how the given angles fed to motors in the manipulator by wbu\_motion\_play() function. 



The final target is to implement the controller in the real world using Raspberry pi or FPGA microcontrollers. So by using wbu\_motion\_play() functions how can I do it? Where can I find the function description? If this method is impossible, it will be great if you can give guidance to make it a success. 



your response will be highly appreciated !!

ah ok, it looks I should use `export WEBOTS_HOME=/var/lib/snapd/snap/webots/current/usr/share/webots` instead


any idea what might be the problem here?


I don't find that .so file in my webots installation. I have [juanrh@juanydell hello\_webots\_py]$ ls $WEBOTS\_HOME/lib

bindtextdomain.so  systemd  udev  x86\_64-linux-gnu


Hi, I'm a newby trying to use webots with Python. I'm on Fedora 30 with webots installed with snap. I did export WEBOTS\_HOME=/var/lib/snapd/snap/webots/current export PYTHONPATH="${WEBOTS\_HOME}/usr/share/webots/lib/python37"

export PYTHONIOENCODING='UTF-8'

export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH="${LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib" and when I launch `python3` and do `import controller` I get "ImportError: libCppController.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/05/2019 07:21:00
`@iloving`, we are currenlty running some migration on our server. This might take some time, in the meantime you can use the latest version of Webots which doesn't require any internet license: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2019b-rev1](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2019b-rev1)

##### SimonDK 11/28/2019 18:09:02
Great to hear it is in the long-term plans at least 😊 I get there are more urgent things. If time would allow it, I would give it a go 😁

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/28/2019 07:33:06
Yes we have some long-term plans to improve the scene-tree in Webots, but those are long term plans and will not be implemented in a near future (unfortunately we have currently more urgent things to improve), but if you want to try implementing this you are welcome to contribute 😉

##### SimonDK 11/27/2019 17:01:08
Regarding the Webots graphical interface, I was wondering if there are any plans to have somethings like groups or folders in the Scene Tree, or being able to drag'n'drop to reorganize items? In big simulations you easily lose overview of all items 😀

`@Fabien Rohrer`  Thank you so much!!! Maybe I should try step by step!!!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 16:11:50
But using a predefined map to start is certainly simpler.


[https://gist.github.com/fabienrohrer/543c2a9751eefc6d352e6957e6e3dc90](https://gist.github.com/fabienrohrer/543c2a9751eefc6d352e6957e6e3dc90)


The objects of a scene and their size may be retrieved using a supervisor, like this:


Does this answer your question?


If I were you, I would first use an existing library to deal with the algorithm, and a predefined map stored in the controller. Webots can retrieve easily the robot position in the map.


`@Ella` Hi, I confirm this task may be hard. There is currently no example about such implementation.

##### Ella 11/19/2019 16:04:03

no i will try

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/13/2019 12:51:26
did you try to revert or reload the whole simulation instead?


I fear that some error is accumulated.

##### pavlos27 11/13/2019 12:49:22
this happens after 50-60 resets


but this doesn't happen at first reset


but still collisions forces are applied after reset

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/13/2019 12:47:48
(the floor.resetPhysics() is certainly useless, because a floor has no physics)


it sounds very correct to me.

i have 2 robots and a rectangle arena . The robots are moving only in one linear direction  one behind the other and sometimes they are colliding . When i reset my robots to their initial position like this

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/13/2019 12:29:50
Could you better describe what does not work?

##### pavlos27 11/13/2019 11:20:07
unfortunately this didn't worked either

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 07:20:24
`@pavlos27` Would it be possible to translate it at the floor level, but to add a very small vertical offset, just in order to avoid collisions with the floor during the translation?

##### pavlos27 11/10/2019 10:30:11
i don't know what to do to fix that do you have any ideas?


i have reset the physics of the floor too, but still i have the same problem


it will always colliding with the floor


i see contact points with the floor but what that means?my robot can't be in the air

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/07/2019 16:16:08
By checking the contact points you can see if it does collide with the floor. If you don't see any contact points then it means that it is not colliding: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu)

##### pavlos27t 11/07/2019 10:41:35
how can i make sure the wheels are not colliding the floor?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/07/2019 07:58:34
`@pavlos27t` you should make sure that the wheels are not colliding the floor when you move the robot. It is also recommended to check what is happenning with the contact points just before and just after the reset, you can see this in the view / Optional Rendering menu.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 13:26:07
you probably want to reset the physics of the robot too indeed: wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics

##### pavlos27t 11/04/2019 13:25:22
if collision happens and forces applying should i reset the forces too?


i reset my robots like this [http://prntscr.com/ps9cqr](http://prntscr.com/ps9cqr)


the ground is flat, but there is a possiblity for the e-puck robot to collide with another e-puch robot that i have in the simulation

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 13:17:21
Hi `@pavlos27t`, just to make sure you are speaking about simulation right? Does the robot collide with something? is the ground flat?

##### pavlos27t 11/04/2019 13:16:17
Hello Sir, i have a strange problem: i give equal speed on left and right wheel of e-puck robot but it doesn't move linear, i print my velocities to confirm it and they are equal ,so why my robot turns?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:08:37
Hi `@threeal`, usually controllers are automatically started by Webots when you run the simulation if the is used by any robot node, i.e. the Robot.controller field is set to your python controller name. Does this not work for you?

See details here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#standard-ros-controller)


You can use the ROS controller provided in Webots with your own new robot design. There is no need to modify it. You will simply have to figure out the topics and services published by it.


See this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)


Of course you can create your custom robot in Webots.

##### threeal 10/23/2019 10:31:58
`@David Mansolino` thank you for the answer, but is it possible to create a custom robot in Webots? As my robot is custom made and not based on sample robot provided by the Webots simulator.



And what about the ROS controller provided by Webots? can i use it in my custom made robot or should i create custom made controller for my robot that work as bridge between ROS and Webots?.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/21/2019 06:57:24
`@SimonDK` :

> Going to try Webots with ROS very soon. At least for me I have grown very tired of Gazebo. It always feels unstable, cumbersome to set up and we have to use many hacks to get it to work somewhat ok with Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

For sur it will 😉 let us know if you have any issues doing so.


`@Flo`, that sounds very interesting, looking forward to see this too!


> anyway, is it possible to treat webots controller as ros node?



Yes of course, we have developped an interface with ROS1 which is a controller that acts as a generic bridge between Webots and ROS1: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros/](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/)



And we are currently creating an interface with ROS2, for this new version we are using the Webots API directly in the ros nodes: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros2](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros2)



Let us know if you have any precise question


`@threeal`, Webots has several advantages compared to Gazebo, here is a non-exhaustive list:

  - Cross-platform [windows, linux, mac].

Stable physics engine.

  -An efficient rendering engine using Physically Based Rendering for realistic images.

  -A simple and intuitive user interface.

  -Wide range of simulated sensors and actuators available and ready to work.

  -Wide range of robot models available and ready to work.

  -Wide range of documented samples.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/26/2019 06:20:06
`@Anoop` The `Skin` node is a pure graphical functionality that only modifies the mesh of the robot but doesn't affect the physics.

Webots cannot simulation soft robotics because ODE (the Webots physics engine) doesn't support soft body dynamics.

However there are some tricks to transform a soft robot model into an hard model that could help in simulating soft robotics application.

##### Anoop 09/25/2019 17:45:20
Thanks `@Stefania Pedrazzi` for the information. Can I assume this as a soft robotics or more generally can SKIN node be used for generating soft robotics model?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/25/2019 06:17:19
Just note that the `Skin` node used to implement the skin animation is still experimental, i.e. it can be used but it is not documentated as the functionality could still change.


Hi `@Anoop`, yes this robot is included in Webots. You can find it in the simulation `projects/samples/rendering/worlds/animated_skin.wbt`

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 10:42:31
It still doesn’t work `@fa`

##### MerySgh 08/21/2019 10:39:32
ok i'm going to see it .. i think i'm not clear enough ... ok the car made an accident with pedestrian because it's attacked from different attacks 

thanks to this attack that the car does not see the passenger crossing the road in my case the attack is jamming

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 10:30:22
Could such traffic simulation meet your expectations?


Please take a look at this link and the movie: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/sumo-interface](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/sumo-interface)


In Webots, you can simulate vehicle traffic using SUMO (it's an open-source application which simulates vehicle traffic and which can be interfaced with Webots):


If I understand well, you need to simulate a traffic jam after the collision, right?

##### MerySgh 08/21/2019 10:26:29
sumo ? what do  you mean ?

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 10:24:53
`@Fabien Rohrer` one minute. We are restarting everything again

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 10:23:32
`@MerySgh` are you using SUMO to manage the traffic?


`@BlackPearl` so you did downgraded to java and javac 1.8 and clean/build your controller again?

##### MerySgh 08/21/2019 10:21:55
I  made the accident but how to develop the attack I do not know yet

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 10:21:46
`@MerySgh` haha makes more sense

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 10:21:14
`@Fabien Rohrer` it’s still not working ....

##### MerySgh 08/21/2019 10:20:57
mmm actually !! I'm supposed to develop  jamming attack in my project ... for more clarifying I have a project of autonomous vehicles and I have to make an accident with a passenger in the road according to jamming attack

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 10:16:07
Do you have something else in mind?


Hi, Webots is mainly a Desktop app. A jamming attack has not much sense to me. Do you speak about the streaming sever? Our websites?

##### MerySgh 08/21/2019 10:13:23
hello everyone !  has anyone have developed jamming attack in webot  before ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 10:10:23
(it's probably the simplest solution indeed)

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 10:10:07
Ok thank you very much. We are downgrading

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 10:09:36
Let me know if you have troubles with this.

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 10:08:38
Hm ok


*ubuntu


Unbuntu

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 10:05:45
You should either downgrade your Java, or either recompile the library with your Java version (normally it's quite simple, just a matter to install `swig`, define `WEBOTS_HOME` and type `make` in `WEBOTS_HOME/resources/languages/java`)


What OS are you using?  arch?


We are precompiling the Java library with OpenJDK 1.8.0\_222.


ok, this is certainly the issue

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 09:56:07
not sure. could you give us more precisely your Java version (`java -version`)? It is supposed to be `1.8`. Does it matches with your `javac -version`?

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 09:53:19
Hm so why the error accurs

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 09:52:20
on linux, OpenJDK is supposed to work,

But yes we are using the openJDK


No we are running Linux

oops, I think I'm wrong: I was sure you were on windows.

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 09:51:07
We Will change to the oracle jdk


`@Fabien Rohrer`  oh ok thanks for the quick answer

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/21/2019 09:49:08
(the java libcontroller is precompiled with the last 8 version of the Oracle JDK)


How did you installed Java? Your log seems to refer to OpenJDK while we recommend to use the Oracle JDK: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-java#windows](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-java#windows)

##### BlackPearl 08/21/2019 09:45:02
It’s a java controller


Anything we need to pay attention?


`@David Mansolino`  so we are using the new version but we got the controller crash again

##### Deleted User 07/20/2019 10:21:57
`@BlackPearl` hello sir, are you using nao ?

##### BlackPearl 06/28/2019 05:00:03
`@David Mansolino`  thanks, will try

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2019 06:15:07
`@BlackPearl` can you please try with the latest version of Webots that we releeased yesterday: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/releases/latest](https://github.com/omichel/webots/releases/latest)

##### BlackPearl 06/21/2019 04:11:49
The latest (java 8 and webots R2019-R1)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 14:05:24
`@BlackPearl` which version of Webots and which version of Java are you using ?

##### BlackPearl 06/20/2019 13:54:38
That’s why we created our own but still get this error


Yes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 06:54:45
`@BlackPearl` do you get this error with the controllers distributed within Webots?

##### BlackPearl 06/19/2019 18:15:12
Actually we tried today different controllers but always getting this error

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/19/2019 08:54:04
Do you have any way to debug your controller?


A priori, this bug is on your side.


It seems your controller called SensorController crashes.

ok, good luck!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:50:20
Ok, then everything is perfect with your hardware. I will check when I have time and let you know

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:49:17
OpenGL 4.6 (415 ext) - Quadro P3200/PCIe/SSE2


yes other apps work fine and i use the vive often

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:41:28
We haven't tested it with this GPU, but it should works fine.

Do you know which OpenGL version you are using?

Are other application working fine with the Vive headset?


> 0 means infinity?



for far yes

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:37:35
P3200 mobile


0 means infinity?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:37:13
By the way what is your GPU ?


Ok, then yes it doesn't seems it is clipping the problem, but rather an issue with OpenGL


(value are in meters)

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:36:44
same result with 100

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:36:30
Can you try increasing it to something like 100 ?

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:36:24
that means for me, clipping is not the problem, right?


see difference far 0 (default) vs. far 1

> the good news: you can simulate the behaviour without a vive, right?



Kind of, but still the vive API in itself interfere with OpenGL and this is maybe the cause of the problem.

But as soon as I have time I will try to reproduve this.


Can you try playing with the Viewpoint, near and far value ?

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:31:10

No problem that was not clear from my side too.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:30:42
i think so


yes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:30:31
Ok, than this make more sense, so the problem is really what is rendered in Webots

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:30:26
sorry, english is not my mother language, i thought you mean the vive handles (controllers)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:30:04
> i do not see the rendered vive controllers in both the webots preview and in the vive



that's normal we did not yet interfaced the vive controller with webots.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:30:03
yes, i also see them in the vive (its exacly the same image)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:29:38
No sorry, I mean the red,green and blue arrows you can see in Webots.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:29:37
i do not see the rendered vive controllers in both the webots preview and in the vive


just to be sure: you mean with "handles" the two controllers from the vive?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:27:56
Ok, so you can see the handle in the preview but not in the headset ?

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:27:23
the vive preview in webots and what i see in the vive is the same

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:23:28
that's very strange, you should see exactly the same in the Webots view and in one of the two eyes in the headset. Probably there is something not clean with OpenGL on our side.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:13:10
oh, and i can rotate the cameraview per mouse while vr is on


(but i set both options to true in the webots gui)


and the position is not tracked, but the rotation from the vive


no handles

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:10:35
Can you see the handle in the headset too?

interessting: when i click on some objects in the treeview, the coordinate systems are shown in the vive


set to 50%, same issue

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:02:05
Yes, maybe near-clip, or maybe a resolution issue. can you try setting the VIve resolution to 50% (you can set this in the preference of SteamVR). and then reboot Webots.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 15:01:42
exact

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 15:01:22
At least if shows that the connexion with the Vive is correctly established

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:55:26
maybe a near-clipping problem because of different scales?


ok. the color shown in the vive is the same as the "/Background/SkyColor" (i changed it to red to test it)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:53:18
Then if you are using the 'develop' branch you are indeed very close to the R2019b version 😕

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:51:43
world file was "nao\_robocup.wbt"


i just tested the vive in the 2019b, same problem: colored background but no objects


on the develop

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:48:16
It depends on which git branch you are ?

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:47:19
i'm not sure, but isn't the version i just build from webots the 2019b you mean?


ok, thats the one i used too

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:42:11
Many of them, but I remember I tested I lot the 'robotis/soccer.wbt' world

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:41:36
whats the world you tested the VR?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:41:33
That's indeed not normal, but we changed some part of the VRHeadset code for the next release, so please try again.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:40:54
only a light blue/grey background color


when i move the headset, nothing happens


ok

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:39:55
Not yet, but we will release R2019b soon. Unfortunately I don't have the time right now, but if you test with R2019b when we will release it and the problem is still present, please do not hesitate to tell us.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:37:41
i'm using the webots 2019a Rev 1 from some weeks ago. is there a newer version?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:37:02
Where you able to view the simulation in Webots moving when you were moving the headset ?


That's strange we did test it a few weeks ago and it was working fine. Unfortunately we don't have any VIve available right now to test.

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:35:07
i think the vr-function in webots is broken. i tried to view a simulation with the htc vive and steam vr but only a blue background appers in the view. when i deactivate position and rotation tracking in the webot gui, a coordinate system (webots style) is displayed in the vive in the center of the display, but no other objects from the scene)


time for another question? 😉

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:31:54
Perfect !

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:31:48
make is completed and was successful!


btw.: great that webots is open source now!

😄

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:20:22

OPEN\_VR\_INCLUDE = -isystem $(WEBOTS\_PATH)/include/openvr

Into

OPEN\_VR\_INCLUDE = -isystem $(WEBOTS\_PATH)/include/openvr/headers

and try to recompile ?

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:19:35
seems like an error in the makefile (missing include directory?)


right

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:18:54

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:08:42
what is the output of your make -j6 command ?


It should not impact openvr, but it is worse trying

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:07:33
ok, but i think, its not the solution for the openvr problem, right?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:07:10
if you want to have npn install (and some other optionnal dependencies) you can install them by running './src/install\_scripts/msys64\_installer.sh --dev' from the webots directory


Npn is completely optionnal


python is higly recommended (even so it is not required to compile the core of Webots).

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:05:53
ok, how ever, is python and npm needed or only optional?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:04:52

is there some trick in discord to send code in a more compact way in the chat? 😄


ok, same error after make -j6

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 14:00:51
if they was no error its not needed to send the output


Ok, can you retry to do a 'make'

##### TH0 06/12/2019 14:00:30
should i send the output in the chat?


done

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 13:59:40

Hi, welcome.

##### Thelm76 04/25/2019 10:40:32
also, on the wiki, I've seen that the accelerometer and the gyro are encoded on 6 bytes so 2 bytes for X, Y and Z. But the magnetometer is encoded on 12 bytes, which doesn't make sense to me as the raw values are between -32460 and 32760... So are there 3 axis encoded on 4 bytes, or am I missing something?


Hi, I don't know if this is the good place to post this, tell me if I'm wrong.

I'm actually trying to implement a full support for the e-puck's missing sensors in webots (especially for V2). 

After editing the proto file to add them in the simulation, I am now trying to implement the wifi communication by following this : [http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2\_PC\_side\_development#WiFi\_2](http://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2_PC_side_development#WiFi_2)



and I'm facing two problems for now : in this piece of code (e-puck\_wifi/Wrapper.cpp) I don't understand the calibration values for the accelerometer so I can't transpose them to the gyro and the magnetometer



TripleValuesSensor *accelerometer = DeviceManager::instance()->accelerometer();

  if (accelerometer->isEnabled()) {

    const double calibration\_k[3] = {-9.81 / 800.0, 9.81 / 800.0, 9.81 / 800.0};

    const double calibration\_offset = -2000.0;

    double values[3];

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

      short int acc = sensor\_data[2 * i] + 256 * sensor\_data[2 * i + 1];

      values[i] = calibration\_k[i] * (acc + calibration\_offset);

    }

    wbr\_accelerometer\_set\_values(accelerometer->tag(), values);

  }
