##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:44:58
It worked!


`@Luftwaffel` trying it now

##### Luftwaffel 07/08/2020 11:35:45
Did you follow the tutorial Stefania posted above?

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:35:40
Windows

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 11:34:56
Windows here

##### Luftwaffel 07/08/2020 11:34:51
you guys on linux or windows?


The start of your controller in your own IDE should look something like this:



from controller import Supervisor



robot = Supervisor()

timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 11:34:17
I remember I got the same errors as `@GeoCSBI`, regarding the DLL load. My controller itself found the files it needed. But when the controller imports "controller.py", "controller.py" again tried to import "\_controller.py" or something. And I somehow had only given the files in my project access to what I needed, and not other files like "controller.py".. (Atleast that's what I think was happening)

##### Luftwaffel 07/08/2020 11:32:45
If your paths are correct and you import the controller in pycharm, you set the controller to extern in webots, then you should be able to run the controller inside pycharm

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:31:51
even if i had done something wrong on the webots side, shouldn't Pycharm run the code? I will try and re-modify the paths

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 11:31:25
Here is the documentation for extern controllers:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-language=python)

##### Luftwaffel 07/08/2020 11:31:04
Just set your paths like I posted above and it shoulud work.

 export WEBOTS\_HOME='/usr/local/webots' 

you might have to change, depending on your install


ah okay, know what you mean

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 11:29:10
True `@Luftwaffel`, but to set up the controller to use externally, it's nice to get a default set-up by Webots (by using their Wizard) üôÇ

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:29:04
`@EPIC` I didnt create a new virtual environment, i followed `@Luftwaffel` way, set controller to extern

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 11:27:36
yes, PYTHONPATH should also contain `${WEBOTS_HOME}\lib\controller\python37`

##### Luftwaffel 07/08/2020 11:27:31
you dont need to create a new controller inside webots. Simply select 'extern' as the controller

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 11:26:00
Hi `@George`! I've been struggling a bit with PyCharm aswell. One of the thing I keep forgetting is to create a new project (and thereby a virtual environment) in PyCharm, after I have used Webots' "Wizard" to create a new controller. Have you created one?

##### Luftwaffel 07/08/2020 11:25:21
my .bashrc contains this:

export WEBOTS\_HOME='/usr/local/webots'

export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH="${LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller"

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller/python27"

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${WEBOTS\_HOME}/lib/controller/python37"

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:25:06
so i suppose is included


I have to to content root and the Add content root to PYTHONPATH is checked


`@Stefania Pedrazzi` I have only included it to PATH, should I add it to PYTHONPATH too?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 11:22:59
`@GeoCSBI` did you add the `<WEBOTS>\lib\controller\python37` both to PYTHONPATH and PATH?

##### GeoCSBI 07/08/2020 11:17:10
Hey guys, I have a question regarding PyCharm with Webots (Windows). I have followed this guide: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide?tab-language=python#pycharm](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide?tab-language=python#pycharm)



However, when I am trying to run Webots from PyCharm I get this error:



  File "...\Webots\lib\controller\python37\controller.py", line 15, in <module>

    import \_controller

  ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.



Any suggestions? I have included the Paths to the Enviromental Variables and followed all steps.

About threadsafe properties, here are some additional documentation:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_task\_new](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_task_new)


`@oroulet` the `supervisor.step` function makes the simulation (physics computation, rendering, sensor measurements etc.) to run for the specified time step. If you don't call it regularly, then the simulation doesn't run.

##### oroulet 07/08/2020 11:05:23
just to make sure I understand clearly the way webots work:  Every call to the webots API is not threadsafe and must be done in that big loop:



          while supervisor.step(self.time\_step) != -1:

                # do something

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 09:09:13
You're welcome

##### oroulet 07/08/2020 09:08:58
OK . that is what we do now. Thanks

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 09:07:48
Unfortunately not, you have to get all of them and then check the distance manually to the point.

##### oroulet 07/08/2020 09:07:10
Is there a way to get a list of solids within a given volume? or within a range from a point?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 08:44:06
A very simple simulation world + controller would be nice.

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 08:43:13
Sure üôÇ I manually added the object now (when the simulation were running), and the same problem occurred. When reporting, should I just describe the problem (like above)? Or do you need the code and the simulation-world?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 08:23:58
Ok, in that case that is maybe a bug, can you try reproducing the issue with a very simple example (even if it implies adding manually the new object while the siulation is running) and report it here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

thank you

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 08:20:53
No :/ I also tried to add the object as a child before I started the simulation - then everything worked just fine

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/08/2020 08:20:04
Hi, does the object you imported overlap the bounding object of the touch sensor?

##### EPIC 07/08/2020 08:18:25
The output from the touch sensor is != 1 while I'm holding the object, both while overlapping other bounding objects and not


Hi! I'm having trouble with my touch sensor. The bounding object of the sensor is set at the end-effector of a robot, and is working just fine when there is nothing attached to the end-effector. But when the end-effector (gripper) is picking something up, the touch sensor doesn't work anymore (it starts working when I let go of the object that I picked up). Any idea why this could be happening?

Additional info: I'm not using physics (pure kinematic simulation). When I grab/pick up an object, I'm importing the object as a child of the end-effector/gripper (and then remove/delete the original object). When I put the object down/let go, I reverse the process (import the object into the world, then remove/delete the child-object from the end-effector/gripper).

`@Luftwaffel` thank you very much .

##### Luftwaffel 07/07/2020 11:50:45
`@ùêé ùêç ùêà` you can change your controller here. If you want to create a new controller inside webots, use the wizard (top of the screen). If you select extern, you can have your controller running outside in your Terminal or IDE of your choice

Hi. I'm new to webots and i've to make a multi-robot system coordonation project using Webots. After i went through the tutorial and saw the basics i'm trying to make my own project. But when i add the pr2 robot for example to my world and project the robot does the things he do in the demo and uses the controller from demo. all i want is to use the robot but to code myself the controller. Can someone help me with some answers or to explain me what i've to do ? i know it sounds dumb ,but as i said i'm new to Webots .I tried to look up for other tutorials than the cyberbotics ones and i couldn't find  things related to my problem.

##### yash 07/07/2020 09:34:43
Okay let me check it out

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/07/2020 09:31:56
Not necessarily, you can also define yourself the  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variable before starting your node (see more explanation here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#environment-variables](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux&tab-language=python#environment-variables))

##### yash 07/07/2020 09:23:19
webots\_test01.py is a publisher node . So do I create a webots\_ros\_python.launch file and include the content as given in the above link .?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/07/2020 08:25:01
It seems you are not using the standard controller, what does 'webots\_test01.py? contain?

Did you set the PYTHONPATH to point to the Webots Python library?

Something like this: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/33d834e8debcc7c38a9be1144a48ae52971d303e/projects/languages/ros/webots\_ros/launch/webots\_ros\_python.launch#L12-L13](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/33d834e8debcc7c38a9be1144a48ae52971d303e/projects/languages/ros/webots_ros/launch/webots_ros_python.launch#L12-L13)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/07/2020 06:19:40
What do you mean exactly by 'fixed frame'.

Since you can now the resolution and field of views of the camera, if you know the position and orientation of your camera (which you can get using a gps and inertial unit for example) you have everything you need to compute the object position (except the distance).

##### Gowtham 07/07/2020 06:12:27

Webots doesn't include any built-in generic navigation controller, in the provided simulations the robots are mainly using obstacle detection based on sensors


Hi `@Emna`, knokwing the target position you can use for example the GPS device to compare the current position with the target position and compute the motion direction. Based on that you just have to set your robot motors to move in that direction.

Hello .!

I am using Webots with ROS . I am programming a publisher and subscriber node using visual studio code , then should have to save the nodes in the source file(src) of  webots\_ros Package? 

And what about the controller field of the robot node , which controller should I select there .?

##### Emna 07/06/2020 09:49:29
hi, how can i get a navigation controller to a specific target, i will use it to implement my model

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:49:11
you're welcome

##### EPIC 07/06/2020 09:48:26
Ah, clever.. I didn't understand how to use it from the documentation, but that example were really nice. Will see if I can make it work as in the example, thank you!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:41:42
this is for example done in the SumoSupervisor controller: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/controllers/sumo\_supervisor/Objects.py#L158](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/controllers/sumo_supervisor/Objects.py#L158)


for example storing all the box description in a variable (or file) and just adding the DEF name part dynamically just before calling the import instruction


so you can dynamically build the string in the controller


With the Supervisor API you can also import a node from string:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)

##### EPIC 07/06/2020 09:35:45
How could I set a different DEF name? üôÇ


Oh, really? That would be a better solution indeed

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:35:05
It is also possible to import objects in runtime and set a different DEF name

##### EPIC 07/06/2020 09:34:29

%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/729631350306504744/unknown.png)
%end


They all have the same DEF, as I import the same object in run-time (a robot is picking up a box - I'm importing a box inside the grippers child-node, and deletes the original box when picking it up). To keep track of all the boxes, I sort them by ID

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:32:39
what I could suggest you is to use DEF nodes to identify your boxes instead of the internal unique id


the best would be to provide a fully working example


sorry but this part of code doesn't help very much given that most of the functionality is still missing

##### EPIC 07/06/2020 09:28:30
Where "self.id\_box\_list" is the list of ID's it's looping through. I have checked that it's not an index-error. The new ID is added to the list, but it doesn't seem to find the object with the given ID

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 09:24:28
`@EPIC` could you provide some code so that we can better understand what you are doing?

##### EPIC 07/06/2020 09:23:06
Hi! I'm trying to loop through a list of ID's but I'm having some problems. I also read in your documentation that looping through ID's is not recommend. Is there an obvious reason it doesn't work? (I'm adding a node in run-time, adding its ID to a list, and loop through the list)

Quick question:

The format of the raw image bytes from

Thanks a lot. It works

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/06/2020 07:59:31
Ok, the problem is probably related tot he fact that you have to do a robot.step between the camera activation and the getImageArray call

##### chenpixx 07/06/2020 07:59:03
It normally works.


I received after reset

`@ThomasH` very nice simulation world!

as `@Luftwaffel` said, you should be able to improve the stability by simplifying the bounding objects (make sure to use only basic geometries such as box, sphere, cylinder, etc.)

`@Doc` probably that the one not receiving shadows has an alpha channel, if a textures has an alpha channel then the object is considered as partially transparent and therefore doesn't receive or cast shadows

A very low basicTimeStep=2 seems to work fine (though the simulation speed is very slow). thanks for your help


though the warning still pops up every second

I am using the iRobot create

##### Luftwaffel 07/05/2020 12:04:51
what robot are you using√ü


The bounding objects that is


instead of a triangle/point mesh, defining things as base geometries like spheres, cylinders and boxes, immensely increases accuracy and performance


and the biggest difference you can make, is to simplify geometries

Yes that looks like a good idea!

Perhaps we can create something temporary, where people can easily upload

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 13:20:28
Worse case feel free to create a github repository with your model and we can then host it under the 'cyberbotics' Github organization.


Yes sure, but if you create a model, do not hesitate to create a pull request to include it in Webots: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots)

I know that we are a bit picky with the model quality for integrating them, but it is on our roadmap to create a system allowing users to upload model in beta quality.

##### Luftwaffel 07/03/2020 13:19:12
would make webots more attractive as well, if people can simply load their stuff


I know that optimizing a model is more work, but having some working sample easily accessible would be nice


It would be nice to have a "alpha" version of more robots. Say I make a proto for a kinova arm, it would be nice if other people can get it too. And vice versa ofc

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 13:16:22
> Do you have .protos of kinova arms?

`@Luftwaffel` no, but it should be quite simple to convert one from URDF as we have already tested our URDF converter with some kinova model and it was working quite well: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots#notes](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots#notes)

ok perfect, let us know.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/03/2020 07:21:36
I will try to realize if it is really related to collisions. If it is, I think i will need to use the debug version with GDB `@David Mansolino` , even I am not very familiar with that.


oh... ok. I will see if it is possible to port directly to R2020b and test again.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:19:40
It also may be worth trying with a recent nightly build of Webots R2020a revision 2 or R2020b as we fixed several crashes since the release of R2020a revision 1.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:18:00
In that case you might use the contrary, make sure you never relocate two robots to the same position and check if it still crashes.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/03/2020 07:17:26
R2020a revision 1


Yes. The way we tried to reproduce was relocating two robots to the same position. But we don't if that is what actually happen in our environment right before the crash.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:17:05
`@Luiz Felipe`: which version of Webots are you using?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/03/2020 07:09:27
This is indeed a crash. The simplest solution to find where it comes from is to try to reproduce the crash in a very simple example.

Alternatively, if you know how GDB works I can provide you a debug version of Webots so that you can try generating a stack.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/03/2020 07:07:13
Is there a way to exactly know where the problem is happening?


But we don't know how to solve that, which part of the environment to simplify to solve that...


We tried to do some tests in which we relocate 2 robots to the same position on the environment, and we experienced webots turning off like this also.


I have the intuition that this can be related to collisions, or other situation that the physics cannot handle.

##### Luiz Felipe 07/03/2020 07:01:52
Is there a more effective way to debug this problem?


But we still don't know if the collisions that can end up in this situation is the responsible for this problem.


We tried to do some tests in which we relocate 2 robots to the same position of the environment, and we experience the turn off problem.

Glass.wbo is in supersior folder.


I use self.importMFNode(self,2,'Glass.wbo')  to add Glass node after the second reset in supervisor file. However it shows  self.importMFNode(self,2,'Glass.wbo');

have you defined 'WEBOTS\_HOME' before starting the launch file?


It all depends on how you installed Webots. but /usr/local/webots with the debian package is correct

`@David Mansolino`

Yeah, I tried all of them,  non of them are working

The only way it works when I run the world and the ROS nodes separately 

Actually I did have this problem a while ago, but I changed my laptop so I'm doing it all over again but the same problem appeared

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/02/2020 06:40:19
(depending on the calibration)


You will probably get similar results with the real robot.


When the robot walks, the measurements oscillate between 5 and 8 kg, which seems fair.


I checked the `nao_demo.wbt` simulation and the total mass of the robot is 5.3 kg and the mass measured by the foot sensors is 6.1 kg which makes an error of 0.8 kg that can be explained by the dynamics model.

might need to read the extern-controllers part


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers)


you can run your ROS code in an external Terminal / IDE. much simpler


Running ROS inside of webots has some peculiarities. For example, the code is only running, if you have the step(timestep) function inside of your main loop

##### l\_eslam\_l 07/01/2020 22:48:47
It only works when I run roscore and the node of the robot I want separately then starting webots and open the .wbt file of the same robot


Thank you for your response.

But the documentation says that unless we want to create our own controller, we should use the standard "ros" controller, it's an interface between webots and the ROS network.

But the given examples seemingly don't work!

##### Luftwaffel 07/01/2020 22:15:28
then I suggest running your ROS code externally, and using the < extern> controller inside webots


Do you want to implement ROS yourself?

##### l\_eslam\_l 07/01/2020 20:48:57
I don't know what I'm missing


Hello,

I'm trying to run ROS with Webots

But I'm not sure whether webots\_ros is working or not

When I try robot\_information\_parser, what should the output be? I get nothing in the terminal nor in webots console

Also pioneer3at example, the robot doesn't move

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:52:38
I understand. I think I got an idea on how to "solve" my PROTO now. Thanks!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:51:09
3. The `translation`/`rotation` field of the PROTO base node should not be set using a lua statement


I know that this could not be very clear, but to get the graphical translation/rotation handle in the 3D view for a PROTO node these three conditions has to be fullfilled:

1. "translation"/"rotation" words should not be used in template/lua statements

2. The `translation`/`rotation` field of the PROTO base node should be IS connected with an open PROTO field


The only option is to use the IS statement instead of the template/lua statement. But also in this case, the graphical handles will only be displayed if the field is also IS connected to the base node translation field


Yes, but if you use them in template/lua statement, then you won't have the graphical handles visible in the 3D scene

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:38:37
Is it possible to make these fields equal to the trans/rot fields?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:35:30
the best practice would be to use other fields with other names for the inner child. Otherwise the graphical handle for the top PROTO node won't be visible

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:34:01
Not sure if I understand your last sentence. I want to keep the graphical handle, but also want to use its values for inner child.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:28:42
yes, this is correct. Graphical handles are not displayed if the translation/rotation fields are not open PROTO fields, or if they are template/lua fields.

The best practice if you are using the translation and rotation fields for inner child nodes is to rename them (for example using "childTranslation").

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:25:49
The graphical translation of my PROTO disappears when i do

```
%{trans = fields.translation.value}%
```


Ah, makes sense. Can always set translation/rotation etc to be the same as the field using lua, I guess?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/01/2020 11:01:54
Normally, you should IS connect only the main translation and rotation for a PROTO.


That would likely make strange results...

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 11:00:42
I was setting translations and rotations using lua for "child frames". The graphical frame is the one linked to the translation and rotation field? What happens if several children "inherit" translation via "IS"?

`@w3. eydi` you should be able to find them in the documentation of the real spot robot. Or you can convert the robot to base node to extract them from the model (right click on the spot node => 'Convert to Base Node(s)').

##### Robsicky 07/01/2020 10:57:13

As a hint, you can check the return value of these getter functions and if you get `None`, that means it failed to retrieve the requested node or field. In your first example, `shape_geometry` was probably set to `None`.


Yes.

Hi, I know one but unfortunately can't share it as this one is condifential, but the idea is quite simple, you can use 2 connector devices, one at the end of the arm (in the vacuum gripper) and the other on the object to grasp.

##### Stanislas Larnier 06/30/2020 12:55:35

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 12:15:24
I see, then you should call `parentNode.getMFNode().getId()` to get the ID.

##### Robsicky 06/30/2020 12:07:41
Is this the same as WbNodeRef?


To use as arg in getFromID( ) later


Unique identifier?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 12:05:18
If so, you can retrieve it from `getMFNode()` after the import.


I am not sure what do you mean by ID? WbNodeRef?


You cannot set the ID when importing, Webots will do it automatically.

##### Robsicky 06/30/2020 12:02:24
Hi. Quick question. I'm using "importMFNode( )" to import a solid as child of another solid. Is there a method to get the ID for this new import? Or maybe better, set the ID when importing?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 09:49:01
That's indeed possible, I never tried using WSL.

What I would like to do when loading the world is to modify some of the parameters automatically to be sure having the same parameters from one simulation to an other. So I do it like follow with some parameters :



sup.getFromDef('motor\_{}'.format(i+1)).getField('maxTorque').setSFFloat(param.MAX\_TORQUE)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/30/2020 07:59:53

torque should indeed not be one of these constant parameters (if it is, then it is a bug), let me check.


You're welcome

##### lojik 06/30/2020 07:20:56
`@David Mansolino` Thank your for your answers and sorry, I did not think to check on python side for arguments...



For the torque, last time we discussed about some parameters that stays constant during simulation. I did not expected torques to be in these ones. Actually my controller is run by webots. But inside the controller I have a "setup" fonction to modify some world parameters. But as you suggested I should do inverse. Set in the world file then load it.

`@Stefania Pedrazzi` You're right I just re-read what he wrote and realized I misinterpreted it.  Too much coffee this morning, need to slow down and read things completely!  That makes sense, thank you for clarifying

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:32:25
`@kentevan` not sure what you mean by subsequent objects...

if you toggle the "physics" field (from the scene tree or a supervisor controller), the object will be deleted and new object with the new physcis condition will be instantiated, so you won't practically notice the object regeneration

##### kentevan 06/29/2020 15:29:28
No problem, thank you for the insight.  So if an object is added to the world, the physics field will be present or not depending on some condition, but there is no way to change this field once instantiated.  However subsequent objects will be affected by that condition when they are spawned

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:19:18
(I am sorry I have to leave, but I will be here again from tomorrow morning)


Yes, if you create a PROTO, you can create a condition around the physics (like in the example I sent), and then change in runtime from the supervisor the field that is trigerring this condition.

##### kentevan 06/29/2020 15:17:26
`@David Mansolino` just to clarify for myself:  is this physics field changeable mid-simulation?  The overall goal here is to differentiate a demonstrated motion from a robot action by making the demonstrated motion separate from robot actuation.  I am running the object through a generated path by directly manipulating the translation field of the solid object, but as soon as there is a pause, the object drops as it is beholden to physics.  My understanding of the above code is that a proto object can be instantiated with one value of the physics boolean field, but this would not allow "toggling" of the physics.  Is that correct?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:11:42

ahh, so replace the node I want to manipulate with one that does not have physics, do the manipulation, then replace again with one that does have physics

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 15:11:21
Here is an example doing this with a simple object:

  - [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/garden/protos/Gnome.proto#L11](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/objects/garden/protos/Gnome.proto#L11)

Unfortunately the SFNode manipulation was not available in R2019. A workaround could be to create a procedural PROTO with a boolean field defining if the node has physics or not: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)

##### kentevan 06/29/2020 15:07:16
`@David Mansolino` I can talk to my team about that, but we are working on a bit of a deadline and I anticipate that being an unpopular option.  Is there any other way?

Okay ... and do I have to clone the git hub repository .?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 14:51:48
Just note that to use it with webots\_ros you have to define $WEBOTS\_HOME to point to this location


Yes, this is where it is supposed to be

##### yash 06/29/2020 14:51:03

You can adapt and extend the controller from samples/devices/supervisor.wbt simulation:

is there an example script?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 12:25:20
At the moment you can get all the NodeRef instances by looping through the robot or scene using the Supervisor API and check for the type.

##### Luftwaffel 06/29/2020 12:24:00
I can easily retrieve a list of all devices in a world. Would be nice to be able to get the node handles too

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/29/2020 11:46:43
There is no direct method to get the NodeRef from a DeviceTag because they are used in different classes and for different purposes.


`@Luftwaffel`:

- a NodeRef is reference to the node instance: this is used mainly by the Supervisor API to get/set fields.

- a DeviceTag is a unique number that identifies the nodes (mainly devices nodes) on the controller side and that is used by the device APIs to to call device-specific functions.

The best way to get a NodeRef is to directly use the Supervisor API (for example retrieving the node from the DEF name).

##### Luftwaffel 06/29/2020 11:34:36

The PR for the correct 3f-robotiq gripper will have to wait I guess üòÑ


I suck at cpp, so I wont try to provide a solution, but I think it should set the position to either the min or max position (whichever is closer to 0)


I submitted a bug report on gitlab just now

Yes, that's it.

##### Luftwaffel 06/27/2020 16:28:40
And I'm guessing that the default position of the parentJoint = 0. So if we dont explicitly define it, the position is 0, and minPosition / maxPosition get's reset, if above or below 0


I think I have found the issue. I didn't dive deep into the code, but it seems to reset min and max pos, if the current value is not inbetween

That's normal minPosition should be inferior to maxPosition.

this is true for using the node api, as well as checking the motors in webots robot view


when minPosition is positive, or maxPosition is negative, getting those Values returns a 0


a motor CAN'T have a positive minPosition and a negative maxPosition

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/27/2020 15:38:40
I don't believe the devices need to be enabled to see them in the robot window. So running the void controller should be sufficient to display device names in the robot window.

##### Luftwaffel 06/27/2020 14:33:54
do you have a script by any chance, that uses a supervisor node to get all devices in a world by going through the scene tree?


to do that, I need the names


`@Olivier Michel` that only works, when the joints and motors are already initialized through the controller.

`@David Mansolino` :  Worked really well.  Essentially wasted the last 3 hrs stuffing around.


`@David Mansolino` :  I did what you suggested about exploding the proto into base nodes.

As such, I've been able to get the Nao into the pose I want.  But how can I put them all back so they work as a Nao again?

Never mind, dumb question.....  Just select the same Root Node.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:14:52
You import should work, it will create the DEF when importing

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:13:51
Ok üòâ How about setting the Def-name while importing? Like in one of the examples, this function is being used: "wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string(root\_children\_field, 4, "DEF MY\_ROBOT Robot { controller \"my\_controller\" }")". 

Is there a specific robot with the name MY\_ROBOT being imported, or are they setting the name of the robot while importing?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:12:24
By the way, to get the root of the robot it is the `wb_supervisor_node_get_self` function üòâ


No, this is unfortunately not possible.

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:11:22
Aaah, I thought that gave you the root of the robot.. very nice! Is there also a command like "setDef(self, string)" ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:09:18
The root node is a hidden  `Group` node, you can therefore get its 'children' field.


Yes, you can use the `wb_supervisor_node_get_root` function that gets the root node: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_root](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_root)

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:07:23
What command could I use in that case, to change the Def name? üôÇ


Also when importing a node in run-time: I want to import a robot from the console, but not inside another field. Is this possible, since the "import"-functions derive from "Field"?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 08:06:42
Yes of course, the USE nodes will be changed accordingly too.

##### EPIC 06/26/2020 08:05:04
Hi! Is it possible to edit Def-names in run-time?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 07:53:18
That's possible, but very tricky and unrecommended. The simplest solution is either to convert the node to base node (right click in the scene tree on the node) either to edit the PROTO to open these fields.

                        name "RHipPitch"

                        maxVelocity 6.40239

                        minPosition -1.77378

                        maxPosition 0.48398

                        maxTorque %{= (version == "3.3") and 8 or 9.8 }%

                      }

Yep, it does not move.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:07:57
Can you do this as well?


Well, if I edit the original file and set the ball position to `-3.22 0.05 0`, the ball stays still when I start the simulation.

##### nap 06/26/2020 06:05:24
No.  I thought it may have something to do with how the ball was contacting the ground, so I've changed the Y axis from the normal 0.5, to bring it down.  But it still does that.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:04:25
It there any initial collision with that ball which may cause an initial motion?

##### nap 06/26/2020 06:02:48
Yes, that's where I got that stanza from.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:02:27
The speed is stored in a hidden field (you should open the world file in a text editor to see it).

##### nap 06/26/2020 06:01:26
I understand what you mean, but there is no speed:

     RobocupSoccerBall {

      translation -3.22 0.0479 0

  }

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 06:01:16
About the kneeling behavior, you should generate a trajectory for each motor that ensures that the robot is always in a stable position (the projection of the center of mass on the floor should lie in the support polygon, select a robot and from the View menu -> Optional Rendering -> Show Support Polygon).


OK, that's because the ball had some initial speed when you saved your simulation. In general, it's not recommended to save a simulation after it has run (you should have received a warning for that). You should re-open the original world file, in which the ball is not initially rolling, stop the simulation, revert the world, move the ball and save the simulation. This way, the ball will not have an initial speed.

##### nap 06/26/2020 05:54:29
I need to make the Nao kneel from a standing position.  If I command it to go to the kneeling position directly, the robot tips over forward.  Is there a way of interpolating the points?


I moved the ball to one of the penalty spots (near the blue goal). And yes, it rolls away without any other interactions.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 05:52:42
For me, the ball doesn't roll away in this simulation. Does it roll away for you before being kicked by a robot?

##### nap 06/26/2020 05:45:16
`@Olivier Michel` yes, it does.  What I've done is put a solid box to prevent it from running away.  That's fine for my purpose.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/26/2020 05:31:50
`@nap`: it shouldn't roll away, does it?

Webots needs a connection to an X server anyhow. So you can configure it to use the onboard VGA if you need the NVIDIA card for other purposes.

##### Tosidis 06/23/2020 13:41:23
What we want to achieve: Run webots on onboard vga, so the Nvidia stays empty for model training


If you have a headless system, i.e., a system without any physical monitors attached, then with the NVIDIA graphics card you could fake a monitor in the X session


will this start using the onboard VGA? or does it still require a more powerfull one?

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:57:56
`@David Mansolino` if i model the planar joint one by one, the mass of the intermediary Solid between Joints should be massless or light enough.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:54:19
no minimum. But you should pay attention to avoid big differences between Solid masses to avoid unstabilities

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:53:39
What is the minimum mass of a Solid allowed for simulation calculation(ODE physics)?


planar jointÔºåsorry

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:50:04
No, you have to add 2 slider-joints one after the other to do this.

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:49:25
Another quesition: How to model the planner joint? i mean 3 DoF in plan, two slide and one rotation. is there a joint option?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:47:23
Yes indeed, that's the way to go

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:38:30
i have to manually calculate the angle values of q1 and q2, then set value to the jointParameters to make sure the right axis position of the last closed-joint, when i was modeling?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:32:17
The angles you want to set are not at the last jo9nt level, but rather at the intermediary joint level, for which the rotation is completely available.

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:31:48
`@David Mansolino`  is the photo clear?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:26:29
Then for the axis, you should simply change the anchor field of the joint parameter

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:25:46
even thought i know how to specify the successor(another Solid, i.e. SolidReference) , I must make sure that the axis of the successor is exactly at the same position of the first Solid?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:24:35
> i mean Webots cannot specify the rotation position of the successor of the joint. `@David Mansolino`

`@Jiajun Wang` no because the sucessor is a Solid already existing, so if you want to change the rotation you should change it at the Solid definition

i mean Webots cannot specify the rotation position of the successor of the joint. `@David Mansolino`

`@Olivier Michel` you are right sir. I figured that out. The console of inspect element was showing errors, saying the textures were not provided.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/23/2020 08:19:25
The SolidReference is quite simple to use actually, when you add the second joint, instead of adding a `Solid` node in the endPoint field you add a SolidReference node, and you set it's `solidName` to be the name of the Solid in the endpoint field of thefirst joint.

##### Jiajun Wang 06/23/2020 08:16:56
`@David Mansolino`  the example is not so clearly. 

So, can it be understood this way: when i was modeling, the position of Solid was the assembly position? The rotational axis of the joint must be coaxial when modeling zhe two Solids, and if they are separated(not coaxial), the rotational axis will not be what i want.

is that soÔºü

Is it a possibility, when I reinstalled webots with the nightly built, that some files were kept and not reinstalled? Or does the install erase all the files first?


Will do

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 13:14:41
Can you check if you have some libjpeg-8.dll in your PATH that might conflict with the one shipped with Webots?


So, I would suspect that in your case, a conflicting JPEG library is found in your PATH and causes problems with JPEG save.


OK, I confirm I can run the example in `WEBOTS_HOME/samples/devices/worlds/camera.wbt` and it works as expected when I change the image type from PNG to JPG (and recompile the controller). The resulting JPG images are well saved (and look correct) in my home folder `C:\Users\username\blue_blob.jpg`


OK, let me check again.

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 12:57:27
I installed 2020a rev2 and I can open the world also. When I save the camera image as a jpeg I still get a distorted image


I see. Both a 2020a and 2020b are on that page


The exe on that page is a 2020b

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 12:50:29

##### G1020BS 06/22/2020 12:49:18
Okay. So if 2020b doesn't work I'll downgrade to r2020a rev2. Do you want me to send the proto files and such or is that no necessary?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/22/2020 12:48:19
OK, I am getting many warnings when loading it (missing proto files, images, etc.) but it shows up and seems fine. I am testing it with an older R2020a revision 2. I will test the last nightly now...

##### novice\_2222 06/19/2020 19:34:51
Hey!

I'm new to Webots and I'm trying to implement inverse kinematics algorithms for robotic manipulators (arms).

I'm currently using the UR10e manipulator.

I already implemented the algorithms in Python and in them I described the kinematics via rotation matrices which I derived from parametrizing the robot structure with Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.

I have also used Matplotlib animations to verify that the algorithms work.

The problem I have is the following:

I'm not able to align the coordinate systems used in my algorithms to those in the simulator.

I thought I just have to align the global coordinate system to the robot's base and check that the initial motor angles (positions) coincide, however I simply can't get it right.

Since I'm not too familiar with how the arm is implemented in Webots, I used measurements provided

by Universal robotics (manufacturers of UR10e) to get the link lenghts and of the arm and I simulated the arm

with motor positions set to 0 for the default angles. I derived the DH parameters from this.

I also added the GPS device in the tool slot to get the end-effector position and orientation.

However, I feel like I have the wrong approach. Is there a better way to do this?

The end goal is to be able to verify that the way I reprezent the robot in the algorithms 

is the same as in the simulation so that I can then calculate the Jacobian and so on.

I converted the UR10e PROTO node into the Robot class, but I don't know to extract the relevant data from there,

like axis of rotation as provided in the HingeJointParameters.

If you can point me to relevant documentation, a sample with direct kinematics on manipulators or explain what

should I do, it would help a lot, thanks.

Hi! Can you try running your opencv controller as an extern controller as explained here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?tab-os=linux). If that still doesn't work, I would recommend you to change the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH variable so that it points to a new folder that you will create and that will contain a copy of libController.so and libCppController.so. The goal here is to avoid that your controller uses the Qt libraries of Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/19/2020 05:22:18

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2020 07:08:30
From the manual it is said that only `mu` should always be set. My guess is that mu will impact the dynamic case when rho and fds are 0.

##### nelsondmmg 06/18/2020 06:56:07

What happens if I apply a torque in a tire with a higher intensity than the longitudinal static friction? Right now I am putting a high value for mu to avoid this scenario, but I noticed that when mu is low the velocity keeps oscillating.

`@Luftwaffel` `getFromDef` can't get node inside a PROTO, this is why you get None. If you are using a beta of Webots R2020b you can use instead the `getFromProtoDef` function ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop&tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_proto\_def](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop&tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_proto_def)) that allows to get node inside a PROTO (in read only mode).

Yes, but why don't you set this in the world or proto file?

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 16:17:27
for that, the gradual field has to be set to true, and the color  field needs to be empty

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:17:11
Can't you simply use the LED.set() method?


I am not sure what you are trying to do...


If you want to change the color of a LED, you should use the LED API instead.

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 16:13:05
uff, okay, the LED node really needs direct functionality to set gradual and color. This is quite painful workflow :p

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:12:38
Yes.

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 16:12:27
otherwise I cant use that functionality


oh wait, the robot has to be supervisor right?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:10:58
You should use getFromDEF() instead of getLED().

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 16:09:34
AttributeError: type object 'object' has no attribute '\_\_getattr\_\_'


LED0 = robot.getLED('led0')

gradual = LED0.getField('gradual')



2nd line throws errer


thx, I'll try

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:05:54
Yes, using the setter.

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 16:05:19
can I also set it that way? as an array=

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 16:04:53
And the data type you receive in Python should be an array of 3 floats.


You should use `getField()`.

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 16:02:19
`@Olivier Michel` Can I address a field of a node directly? or do I have to use the "getField()" function first to get a handle? I'm trying to change the gradual and color field of a LED node. How would I go about that? Oh and what in the heck is the datatype of the color Field? in the documentation it's "color: [1 1 1]" but that's no data type. Slightly confusing

##### nelsondmmg 06/17/2020 15:59:22
Looking through the ODE documentation, each surface has a mu, the static friction constant and a rho, the dynamic friction constant. I cannot find the rho definition in the contact properties node. What happens if I apply a torque in a tire with a higher intensity than the longitudinal static friction? Right now I am putting a high value for mu to avoid this scenario, but I noticed that when mu is low the velocity keeps oscillating. In the picture I used by control to set the throttle, but with a constant throttle value the plot is similar.

I am following

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 15:37:16
Can you follow, or do you want me to elaborate?


you can also do sin(2 * pi * frequency * t)  with frequency being a variable you set. This is the value in Hz, so with frequency = 10, the value oscilates 10 times a second


keep in mind that you have to use sin(2 * pi * t) if you want the value to oscilate ONCE per second, instead of 2*pi seconds (about 6,3 seconds)


let me know if this is clear üôÇ


`@Zenzo` 

`#!/usr/bin/env python2

\# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from math import sin, pi

import time



start\_time=  time.time()

while True:

    t = time.time() - start\_time   #time in seconds going up from 0

    

    value1 = sin(t) # oscilates between -1 and 1

    value2 = sin(t)+1 # oscilates between 0 and 2

    value3 = (sin(t)+1)/2 # oscilates between 0 and 1

    value4 = round(value3,0) # JUMPS between -0 and 1

    value5 = int(value4) # turns value4 into integer

    

    print(value1, value2, value3, value4, value5`)

##### Zenzo 06/17/2020 15:18:18
`@Luftwaffel` I was looking at this conversation and it made me curious as to how you make blinking LED lights with maths, could you explain it a little further? I am very simple so simplifying it will help me to understand thanks.

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:58:30
then we round(sin(...), 0) so we get 0 or 1 and finally we turn it into and integer using int()


as an explanation of the ledValue. I use the simulation time and the sinusfunction to get an oscilating value. So the core is sin(2*pi*time). we need to add the 2*pi, because we want to oscilate once per second, not once per ~6,3 seconds. By multiplying our frequency in hz, we can increase or decrease the frequency. (sin(...)+1)/2 makes it so we oscilate between 0 and 1 and not -1 and 1


I purposefully pasted it as an image. type it yourself and try to understand. if something is not clear, let me know. A good little exercise would be to change the color of one of the LEDs


this has led0 and led1 blinking. I added line 2, 24-26 and 34-37

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:34:39
is it just a blank world with the epuck added?

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:34:18
created that

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:34:11
what about the world file?

ü§ê I don't have a day unfortunately, this sort of just needs to work

there is a free python course here: [https://www.robotigniteacademy.com/en/path/ros-for-beginners/](https://www.robotigniteacademy.com/en/path/ros-for-beginners/)

I agree but the issue here is my timeframe

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:30:10

that sucks, sorry to hear that

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:29:20
Teacher is pretty unhelpful too


since this lockdown started, online classes were minimalised and we were thrown pretty much in the deep end

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:28:32
I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you seem to be missing some basics of python programming. Didn't you get proper instructions with this assignment, or the fundamental courses required to writing python code?

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:23:25
i put this in the controller and now the epuck wont move



class LED (Device):

   def set(self, 0xff0000):

   def get(self):

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:15:58
then you can control the LED using the functions as explained in the documentation (2nd link he sent)


so get a device handle to the LEDs, I havent tested it, but this should work:

LED0 = robot.getLED('led0')

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:12:25
ye

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:12:18
the LEDs are called "led0" and "led1"

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:11:22
can i just get some very high-level instructions here? i just want some leds to blink on the epuck


hence why im here


he isnt available

##### Luftwaffel 06/17/2020 14:09:08
Then I'd suggest asking your teacher

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:06:12
and i dont have time to understandit


thisis just for aschool assignmenti dont understand any of that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 14:04:54
Yes, but it explains how to retrieve device handles with the Python API (which works the same for all the Devices).

##### Davie 06/17/2020 14:02:39
well for starters, that first link says nothing about LEDs

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 14:01:53

In that case, forget about my advice to set the physics to NULL, it's correct the way you did.

but the bottom wheel spins fine and works with rotary motor


now it swings even with rotary motor


before when i added a rotary motor the part just stopped swinging

alright so i currently have only damping saying Null

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 12:11:09

it says Damping Null


What should i set to null? what do you mean with the first link of the robot?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 12:08:28
You should attach it to the static environment. In order to do so, the first link of the robot should have the `NULL` value in its physics field.

##### wessel 06/17/2020 12:06:36
how do i fix this?

##### nelsondmmg 06/17/2020 07:53:47
Ok, thanks. That would be more intuitive, I used I33 as the vertical inertia for a long time üòÖ

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/17/2020 07:52:29
Yes, this is correct. By the way, we are going to introduce the possibility to switch to Z for the vertical axis in an upcoming version of Webots.

##### nelsondmmg 06/17/2020 07:29:02
The vertical inertia moment of the vehicle in this case is the I22? Inside the PROTO file, according to the documentation the first line is I11, I22, I33; considering the color system used in the global coordinates the vertical axis would be y?

`@sanyaade`, I suppose you are on Windows right?

About Qt, it should indeed be possible, but since Webots dependencies on Qt is not negligible, this would be a huge amount of work, and I am not sure to understand what would be the advantage?


> I couldn't find any documentation about skin node to model a spring. Can you suggest if there is any?

`@sinancimen` the skin node is unfortunately not yet documented. However, some examples are availables: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-rendering#animated\_skin-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-rendering#animated_skin-wbt)

##### sanyaade 06/16/2020 18:16:05
Today I used webots in my computing class to teach programming in Python. Students simulate e-pluck using adapted webots Tutorials.

Everything went well but there are couple of hiccups:

    1.) Python 3.7 is requirement so < 3.7 or >= 3.8 will not work

    2.) Python has to be download, installed as system wide in Windows. This creates some issues but most student were able to resolved this.

    3.) I will like to used webots at lower age 6-16 old kids, to teach introduction to Programming (Python) and Robotics (ESP8266/ESP-32 based Robots)



In order to create solution for all the above points, I was wondering may I should compile Webots, packaged with its own Python compiler in order to make portable and non operating systems dependent. Look getting to work with a range of Python compilers versions e.g. > 2.7 or >3.7 as opposed to a fixed version only. (SWIG or SWIG alternative FFI generator(s) ). 



Is it possible to replace QT dependent with [https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) ?  Later to see if I could get my hands dirty to do this as a project



Many thanks for creating and releasing now as open source.

##### Master6 06/16/2020 12:47:20
Well I have a quit complex proto with a lot of parts imported from solidworks, and I have no idea what causes the crash. I can send you the proto if you want, but I don't have the time myself to figure out what's causing it.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/16/2020 12:41:09
That's still a beta so it is indeed not as stable as the latest release :-(

Would it be possible for you to report this bug too (and ideally include a PROTO that reproduces the issue with the report), so that we can make sure it will fix this in the beta?

##### Master6 06/16/2020 12:38:54

It could be the supervisor is launching another process which on your colleague's machine is different from yours and requires Qt...

Yes, but it is strange as the supervisor should not try to find the Qt library. It has no dependency on it...

is it not finding the qt library?

That seems to indicate that the supervisor is linked against Qt...

##### Luiz Felipe 06/16/2020 10:07:56
I don't think it is using Qt directly. The environment is a variant of this repo: [https://github.com/omichel/test\_world](https://github.com/omichel/test_world)


In my personal environment the error does not happen, but when my colleague is running in his environment this error happened. He reinstalled Webots (removing all files related to webots) and the error still happens.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/16/2020 05:07:30
Hi `@Luiz Felipe` which simulation are you running? Is your controller using Qt?

##### Luiz Felipe 06/16/2020 03:36:46
Is any package missing?

About the deformation, you might use a skin node that will make the shape to be deformed when the joint moves.


The Slider Joint can indeed act as a spring, see this chapter abotu the spring and damper effect of joints: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters#springs-and-dampers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters#springs-and-dampers)

Hi. Yes, this is possible, but in that case, you should probably apply forces and torques directly from a supervisor controller instead of using a Propeller device.

Is it possible to make such simulation in which we can study the aerodynamic behaviour of drone.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/15/2020 08:08:21
`@G1020BS`: no idea about this crash... Can you compile one of the provided controller examples with Visual Studio and see whether it crashes too? If it does, that means there is likely a bug with the libController and you should open a bug report. Otherwise, that probably means that your controller has a problem and causes the crash. In such a case, I would recommend you to try to debug your controller by removing lines of code until it doesn't crash any more.

`@nelsondmmg` Ok then this is the problem, glm come with the clone of Webots as a submodule, the clone should be done with the `--recurse-submodules` argument.


Note also that you should not need to install the complete development environment to recompile the driver library, you should be able to reompile the one from your installed version of Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/15/2020 07:07:19
Hi `@nelsondmmg`, we did some calibration of the brake with some other electrical vehicles (e.g. C-Zero) and the brake was following the blue curve.

But to have something closer to the red curve, can you try to replacing this line:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/vehicle/c/driver/src/driver.c#L362](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/vehicle/c/driver/src/driver.c#L362)

By:

```c
const double damping_constant = fabs(instance->brake * instance->car->brake_coefficient)
```

And the recompiling the driver library.

##### nelsondmmg 06/15/2020 06:48:50
Hi, I a question concerning the vehicle control done with throttle/brake. First, using a 3DoF dynamic model I can model rather nicely the acceleration of the vehicle, but the breaking still presents some errors, as one can see at the end of the figure (x is time in ms and y is velocity). The blue line is the executed by webots and the red in the one predicted. I'm using a Tesla Model3, so the braking force calculated was F= max(2 * brakeCoefficient * wTire + 4 * wheelsDampingConstant * wTire, mu * g * m/2), with the mu being defined in WorldInfo. I even tried to modify the brake value in the node of the vehicle, but the behavior remain the same. It seems to me that maybe there is some dynamic friction involved, with is lower than mu, and when the velocity becomes close to 0, the static is used, resulting in a sharp velocity fall to 0. Is there a dynamic mu defined somewhere? I didn't find anything in the ODE documentation.

I can't unforunately find the reason of the original crash, we will investigate this, in any case you should probably extract the value directly from the array as I showed just before.


The following seems however to works fine:

```Python

`@elidor00` there is a problem in your code this:

```Python
value = RangeFinder.rangeImageGetDepth(kinect_values, 150, i, 60)
```

Should be replaced by:

```Python
value = kinectrange.rangeImageGetDepth(kinect_values, 150, i, 60)
```

But even with this fix it seems indeed that it is crashing

Thank you! Even though I didnt write the C controller, i will try to look for non-terminating loops in the internal controller.

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 17:51:19
the simulation only continues, when your main loop in the controller keeps running and calls the robot step function. Perhaps another part in your loop gets stuck. Perhaps something with the sensors


hmm hard to say, I'm a python and ROS guy. sorry

##### Zerfallskonstante 06/12/2020 17:48:22
no, the time is not synchronized between the internal controller and the ada program

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 17:47:49
is the webots controller broadcasting the sim time?


how do you synchornize time?


if it runs in webots, it's not external

##### Zerfallskonstante 06/12/2020 17:46:21
I am not quite sure what you consider an internal or external controller. we wrote a small controller in C which executes in webots. This controller sends the raw sensor data to the external Ada program. The ada program sends the motor data to the c controller. i hope, this description is helpful.

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 17:41:30
`@Zerfallskonstante` do you use an internal or external controller for webots?

##### Zerfallskonstante 06/12/2020 17:22:37
When the simulation freezes, our ADA program can still recieve and send data to our Simulation's internal C-Controller.


Hello everyone,

I am participating in a project where we have a robot-vehicle in Webots. The robots gets its instructions from an ADA program via TCP. The communication works fine and we got the robot rolling. However, our simulation freezes pretty often. This behavior is non-deterministic: Sometimes it happens after just a few seconds, sometimes after a minute. The simulation speed goes to 0 and it does not proceed (not even a single simulation step). What could cause the freezes? We are using the latest stable Windows version.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:40:04
It could be that small texture size are filtered whereas larges textures are not and this filtering takes time?

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:39:07
the resolution

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 15:38:56
Do you mean the resolution of the texture or the size of the texture on the object?

##### ClBaze 06/12/2020 15:38:12
Bigger images make it twice as fast (which is pretty cool for my use case). I am just wondering why ? Because it could help me optimising the other textures I'm using, and make the simulation even faster maybe.


I noticed that using small images impact the simulation speed.


Each texture is applied to a solid representing the april tag.

`@chenpixx`: I just checked darwin-op visual\_tracking.wbt example on Windows and the camera tracking seems to work even after reset. Can you try it?

##### gcarboni1 06/12/2020 10:59:33
thank you `@Olivier Michel` I'll check

##### chenpixx 06/12/2020 10:59:02
ƒ±n older versions, at same code, it works  as far as I know. However the versions dont include new reset command.


In previous version, I cant run perfectly simulation reset in 2020a revision 1. I checked camera dont work also after reset.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:56:01
`@chenpixx`: no idea. Is this problem specific to this nightly build or can you observe it also with other versions?


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/balljoint](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/balljoint)


`@gcarboni1`: using a simple Sphere, possibly with a low friction, should work. The sphere won't rotate in Webots, but you probably don't care. If you want it to rotate, you could implement it using a passive BallJoint node.

##### chenpixx 06/12/2020 10:50:51
What is problem?


Hi, I am using nightly build (10.6.2020) in linux. After simulation reset, I cant take new images from op2 camera.

##### gcarboni1 06/12/2020 10:23:06

something like this...


Hi there

I'm a beginner user of webots.

I'm building my first 2 wheels custom robot, but I need a sphere wheel under the robot board.

Someone can suggest me how can I create it?

üôÑ  darn

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:05:57
This is unfortunately the simplest solution.

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 10:05:35
is there a way, other than converting to base nodes, to find the correct object in the proto file?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:04:04
Yes

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 10:03:58
that would leave the nice look?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:03:41
Just the boundign object should be enough (at least for improving the physics behavior)

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 10:03:19
just the bounding object, or the geometry too?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 10:01:42
Actually instead of low poly meshes it is even better to replace them with basic geometries for the bounding objects (i.e. use a set of boxes, spheres, cylinder, etc.)

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 10:00:36
what is the best course of action here? replace all the geometry entries from the high poly model with the one from the low poly?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 09:59:12
The most important is the contact, the other part are also important but much less

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 09:55:03
or does only the contact surface really matter?


If I were to just replace the gripping portion, and leave the rest of the high poly mesh, would that have a significant performance impact?


on the right is the converted urdf, much simpler.  But it has the issue of the non connected joints.

where should I put the proto file for the PR?


thx, I'll add that too

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 07:58:24
Yes, it will control the maximum torque used by the motor to reach the target position/velocity

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 07:58:14
if I set it to .5 of max torque, it will only grip an object half as tight


quick question: the setAvailableTorque function can be used to control how hard / soft the gripper grips right?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2020 07:56:56
Oh ok, perfect (I was not sure about the state of the proto)

##### Luftwaffel 06/12/2020 07:55:49
`@David Mansolino` I simply used the proto you linked me to. I could create a sample world with a controller though, implementing it.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 15:10:04
Yes, you can connect multiple joints to the same Solid part using the `SolidReference` node ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference)). This is used for example in the Khepera3 gripper : [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/khepera3#khepera3\_gripper-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/khepera3#khepera3_gripper-wbt)

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 14:30:12
is there a way to do this in the model, or do I have to do it with the controller and move 'motors' that dont really exist

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 14:30:12
For now the workaround is to actually put 2 motors and send exactly the same command to both in the controller

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 14:29:29
hmm how would I go about implementing this now? The robotiq 2f gripper has basically 1 motor, and mimics all joints

to change it into a Solid, do I just replace Robot with Solid ontop of the proto file and remove the controller?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 12:41:56
Then if you don't care about the time spent to do the conversion I would recommend NOT to use the 'disable-mesh-optimization'.

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 12:41:16
I want a proper end model, dont care about the speed


would you recommend not disabling the mesh-optimization?


oh okay

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 12:40:20
About the orientation, you might simply use the 'rotation' field to rotate it.


About the Robot, it might indeed be better to just transform it into a Solid node, but it all depends on what you want to do.


You can use the '--help' argument to get more information about these arguments.

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 12:38:02
`@David Mansolino` I managed to do it. But I have a few questions:

what do these arguments do exactly? is there a documentation?

[--output=outputFile] [--box-collision] [--normal] [--disable-mesh-optimization]



- the generated proto is a robot node, while the 3f gripper included in webots is a solid node. Is this important?



- the gripper points sideways when attaching it to the endeffector of a robot arm, as the ros model goes along z axis, not y axis. How do I change this?

Unfortunately not, you have to generate an URDF file from the XACRO one with the xacro command.

you have an objects.py function


and its corresponding proto and modified my code accordingly

I will definitely look into it


ok

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:21:23
it depends on the structure of your node. you might have to do something like: 

robot\_node.motor.get\_position()

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:21:13
but thank you for all your help


but there is an issue using ros\_automobile controller


`@Luftwaffel` Thanks a lot. I will also simultaneously go through all your examples and see if I can figure it out. I was able to use your sumo\_supervisor example to add/delete vehicles on the go


However if I do the same with tesla proto

robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("TeslaModel3")

print (dir(robot\_node))

following are the functions [ego\_vehicle] ['\_\_class\_\_', '\_\_delattr\_\_', '\_\_doc\_\_', '\_\_format\_\_', '\_\_getattribute\_\_', '\_\_hash\_\_', '\_\_init\_\_', '\_\_new\_\_', '\_\_reduce\_\_', '\_\_reduce\_ex\_\_', '\_\_repr\_\_', '\_\_setattr\_\_', '\_\_sizeof\_\_', '\_\_str\_\_', '\_\_subclasshook\_\_']

so I cant actually access the vehicle. hence I thought it was wrong way of accessing

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:18:53
you can access anything within that node

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:17:57
Also by specifying the vehicle name (specifying the tesla proto in wbt file and giving it "EGO\_VEHICLE" name) i can access the following classes

robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("EGO\_VEHICLE")

print (dir(robot\_node))

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:17:04
let me have a look, rebooted to linux

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:12:16
so isnt it possible via code?

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:12:03
you click on the node and should see a DEF variable you can specify

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:12:02
okay

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:11:44
I do it using the GUI

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:11:24
No actually it didn't work. Also how can I assign it a def i mean a name to it


thats why i cant specify it in  wbt file

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:10:34
> robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("TeslaModel3") accessing the tesla model this way but its definitely wrong

`@dimple.bhuta` this works right? you just need to know how to spawn a new tesla and assign it a DEF

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:10:25
and there should be multiple cars spawing at different times


no it has to be dynamic

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:09:51
does it have to be spawned dynamically, while running the simulation, or just once at the start?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:09:46
robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("TeslaModel3") accessing the tesla model this way but its definitely wrong


as i did try


but i am still not understanding how exactly to do it


yes it will be better to use tesla model proto and spawn them


`@Luftwaffel` I want to generate the vehicle from the code not sure about the proto

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:07:57
or use existing protos, and just spawn them in with your code, changing the DEF?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:07:30
and than generate cars like EGO\_VEHICLE1, EGO\_VEHICLE2 etc

##### Luftwaffel 06/11/2020 10:07:30
`@dimple.bhuta` do you want to generate the proto from your own code?

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:07:13
and name is EGO\_VEHICLE and try to reference in via getfromDef


i mean should i create a proto


in that case will I require to generate a proto


but to create it based on some predefined conditions


meaning I dont want to specify that there is a vehicle in simulation using wbt file


The question is how to create EGO\_VEHICLE from the code

##### Marian 06/11/2020 10:04:47
`@David Mansolino` I'll do that. Thanks

##### dimple.bhuta 06/11/2020 10:04:17

`@Marian` ok then it is probably an error on our side, can you please report the issue here including the world file (and ideally the wrml file too)?[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)



Thank you

`@David Mansolino` Hello, you had answered my question previously regarding this. But I still have some doubts. I am sorry I am reading the documentation and sample codes simultaneously.

I understand that in the wbt file I can specify the robot/ vehicle and give it name for example

DEF EGO\_VEHICLE TeslaModel3 {

  translation 6.38 0.4 174.59

  rotation 0 1 0 1.60078733165

  name "agent\_0"

  controller "ros\_automobile"

  controllerArgs "--name=agent\_0 --clock --use-sim-time"

  sensorsSlotCenter [

    GPS {

    }

  ]

}

In this section of wbt file I have specified Tesla vehicle's name as ego vehicle

And using supervisor I can reference it 

robot\_node = supervisor.getFromDef("EGO\_VEHICLE")

trans\_field = robot\_node.getField("translation")

ok thank u a lot , I wouldn't had find it out if you hadn't helped me

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:27:30
Yes, there will be the same issues. Using external controllers works even with tensorflow.

The difference between the two options is that with external controllers you have to start the controllers manually from a terminal, but yes having them starting automatically from Webots (i.e. using a different installation method than snap) is easier.

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/11/2020 09:24:45
so i think the best is to reinstall it


i guess that i'll have similar problems later with tensorflow

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:23:03
2) run your controller external from the snap sandbox (see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure#extern-controllers)) and use the snap installation


You have two options:

1) reinstall Webots from the debian or tarball package ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases))


ok, so then Webots is running on the snap sandbox and the openCV you installed on the system is not available in the sandbox.

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/11/2020 09:20:11
yes straight from the ubuntu software

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:19:46
did you install webots using the snap?

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/11/2020 09:19:38
all work perfectly outside webots


its 4.2


i checked the cv2.\_\_version\_\_ too


yes

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 09:18:13
hi `@black_hammer_67`, did you try to start python3 from a terminal and type `import cv2` to check if openCV is correctly installed?

Hi `@Stanislas Larnier` you can retrieve the Camera parameters using the Camera API ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera)), for example the focal length, the near value, etc.

##### Stanislas Larnier 06/11/2020 06:25:40
Hello. In Webots, how can I obtain intrinsic parameters of a camera?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2020 05:00:33
Hi `@Doc` unfortunately not out of the box, only the viewpoint can genereate video, and only one viewpoint per simulation is allowed. However, the cameras can be used to save pictures at each step (a function of the API is available for this), you can then use these pictures to generates a video.

##### Doc 06/10/2020 18:10:50
Hi again, is it possible to export video from webots with multiple camera angles (without repeating the recording process for each position)?

Sure

##### Luftwaffel 06/10/2020 15:31:21
we might not wanna spam too much here, switch to pm?


is the throttle constant, or do you control it? Because the red line suggest a sudden throttle change

##### nelsondmmg 06/10/2020 15:28:42
Which is the case, since at this point the throttle remains at the same value (because of the controller)

##### Luftwaffel 06/10/2020 15:27:03
hmm it also looks like the blue line would never reach 10 m/s. It looks like an asymptote. This would only be the case, if your max power equals the drag and friction losses at 10 m/s


did you consider rotational energy of wheels?

I'm trying to model the Tesla Model 3 using a dynamic bicycle model, but there is still a performance difference which I cannot explain. For the motor propulsion, I accounted the motor output accordingly ( min value between maxT and the maxP expression, eletric motor), with aerodynamic force and the wheels resistance torque (with 4*c*w as wheel damping). I am for the moment maintaining the steering angle equal to zero, but for the slip friction a model F=c*alpha will be used. Am I forgetting some longitudinal component ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/10/2020 12:54:51
Ok, so if it is a graphical Qt application the best approach would probably be to integrate it as a `robot window` controller plugin (note that this is deprecated and HTML/JS robot windows are preferred over Qt ones).

There are a couple of examples of Qt robot windows in the distributed samples, for example ` projects/robots/nex/plugins/robot_windows/fire_bird_6_window` used in this simulation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/firebird6#fire\_bird\_6-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/firebird6#fire_bird_6-wbt)

It all depends if `rostopic hz` is configured to use sim time or not, but in your case it seems to be the case since 1000ms / 8ms = 125Hz (if it was based on the real time it would be indeed 12.5Hz if your simulation runs at 0.1x)

##### Gautier A. 06/10/2020 08:57:06
So, the publish rate expressed with 'rostopic hz ' is relative to the simulation time instead of ros time ? The timeStep is 8ms, and the simulation runs at 0.10x, so that would means that the topic is updated at around 12.5 hz ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/10/2020 08:54:22
It will depend on the time step of the simulation and the speed at which run the simulation, but yes it is possible that it publishes at 125Hz. To reduce it, when you call the `/camera/enable` service, you should assigne a `value` to the service that is bigger (the value indicates the refresh period).

##### Gautier A. 06/10/2020 08:52:11
So my question would be : does the default ros controller really publish (by default) the camera topic at 125 hz ? If so, how can I diminish that update rate ?

I enable the camera with a rosservice call , and right after, call a rostopic hz on the topic of the camera, and it seems to publish at 125 hz


the controlleur has as controllerArgs " --use-sim-time "

No it is the contrary, add the ackermann vehicle first, and then add the body in the `extensionSlot` field.

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/09/2020 11:42:48
i am trying this right now, what building process should I follow ? Like making a body and add the Ackermann vehicle as a child or the starting node is the vehicle ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/09/2020 11:40:52
Have you tried starting from an AkermannVehicle node?

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/09/2020 11:35:51
yes and i am concerned about the case that the body doesn't let the wheel steer because of collision, but i can't see not a little movement

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/09/2020 11:34:10
did you set all the require boundign object and phsyics nodes?

##### black\_hammer\_67 06/09/2020 11:33:50
i set it to 100000 but the same happens

`@David Mansolino`  so i tried the Hinge2joint with a rotational motor on device one and nothing on device 2, now the wheels are free to move on the x axis but i am trying to steer the wheels by setting the position on the motors and nothing happens

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/09/2020 10:37:49
Hi `@Stanislas Larnier`, where does this model of the motoman gp8 arm comes from, did you created it yourself?

In any case, to make it static with the environment, the root Solid/Robot node should have a boundign object but no physics node (and all the childrens Solid nodes should have both).

##### Stanislas Larnier 06/09/2020 10:10:20
Hello everyone. I am trying to use a motoman arm gp8. I have a problem. When I launch the simulation, the arm is falling. I add staticBase true in the proto file but the base is not static. Is there something else, I could do. Am I missing something?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/09/2020 07:35:43
Maybe you can create a second controller i python and communicate with emitter-receiver.

##### TheWiseSidney 06/09/2020 07:35:09
`@David Mansolino` Thnx it should totaly work but it does not, we already have a controller in .cpp thats why im trying to include python.h to create an embadded system. Have any idea what could be going wrong?

Should i delete the emiter and receiver in children in robot node? Because i added into body slot.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/09/2020 05:33:13
if you use the receiver, fur sure you need it..

> also I am trying to build a custom vehicle with 2 rear rotational wheels and 2 front steering wheels and atm I am trying with 4 motor, one on each joint, and the front once having them rotate around y axis. The problem is that rear wheels are spinning and fronts are not because they are not free to move. Can u help me to solve this problem ? Or there is a different approach for steering wheels ?

`@black_hammer_67` the front one should use a Hinge2Joint node instead of a simple 'HingeJoint' node. BUt an even better solution would be to use the AckermannVehicle node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/ackermannvehicle](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/ackermannvehicle)

> WARNING: 'RobotVisionTestController' controller crashed.)

`@TheWiseSidney` Yes, what you did looks correct to use the python lib in C/C++, howerver, why not directly writting your controller in Python?


> `@David Mansolino` yes i tried, finally i figured out that this issue is only on C as in other languages as python the tag is a string, the only thing i dont get is why in C it has to be 1, what indicates that ?

`@black_hammer_67` that's strange, it shouldn't, escpecially because the Python API is calling the C one, so it is the exacte same function that is called at the end.


`@elkelkmuh` you should make sure that your robot has an emitter device called 'emitter' and if not you can add one in the slot fields.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 09:39:19
Unfortunately, this is not possible, you somehow have to convert it to a string to pass it in the import

The contact material for the prius is called 'ToyotaPriusWheels'.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 08:09:30
Ok, so then the ContactProperties node doesn't target the correct material for your Prius model.

##### nelsondmmg 06/08/2020 07:56:19
I changed to 1e-7 and the behavior remained the same. So I replace the Prius with a model 3 and it worked as it should. Thanks.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 07:44:35
Ok. If you set for example the softCFM value to 1e-06 you should immediately see a difference and the car should be lifted up a little bit (maybe enough).

##### nelsondmmg 06/08/2020 07:43:37
No. I added only sensors (camera, GPS, receiver, emitter, IMU).

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 07:42:55
Yes, in the PROTO file  or if you added any heavy objects/devices to it (in the scene tree)

##### nelsondmmg 06/08/2020 07:42:02
What do you mean by "Change the Prius car model"? Changes in the PROTO file? I don' think so.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/08/2020 07:40:30
Hi `@nelsondmmg`, you should decrease the `softCFM` value of the ContactProperties defined for the `ToyotaPriusWheels` material and the road material.  `softCFM 1e-05` is usually the correct value in the distributed examples. Did you modify the Prius car model?

##### nelsondmmg 06/08/2020 07:27:58
Hi, the following problem keeps happening in my vehicle simulations. Each vehicle's tire penetrates the road, and the effects of such phenomena can be seen in the vehicle's movement. Which parameters should I change to stop this behavior? Thanks.

If you want to calculate the position and orientation of any node relative to any other node, you can take a look at this example in python. It should be easily adaptable to any other language, as it uses simple matrix and vector calculations.

Thank you for directing me towards the documentation


i need to figure out the starting translation (i have figured this out). or rotation coordinates. So i am trying to write the code that calculates these and starts the car from the calculated position in the map.


(that I have of the road map)


Okay so in the wbt file you specify the translation/rotation coordinates and car spawns at that particular location in the map. I am trying to write a code that generates the car during coding/real time and based on my coordinates *

##### Luftwaffel 06/06/2020 10:52:23

`@dimple.bhuta` It is not quaternion. This explains it: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/transform?tab-language=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/transform?tab-language=python)

##### Luftwaffel 06/05/2020 15:15:47
this way you only have to edit the runtime.ini once. And you can use all packages you have in your ROS install


it will then use your path definitions


if you open your terminal, source your workspace, then you can simply run webots from the terminal using 'webots'


My runtime.ini looks like this:

`[environment variables with relative paths]

PYTHONPATH=$(PYTHONPATH):$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python/python/site-packages:$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python/kinetic/dist-packages



[environment variables]

ROS\_LOG\_DIR=ros\_python\_log

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 15:01:11
The `/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/src/webots_ros/msg` part looks useless as this are the sources, but the actuall python files should be located somewhere like `/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages`.

##### Lussfer 06/05/2020 14:59:29
since the custom\_msg.msg is in msg folder


i also tried using `PYTHONPATH=/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python3/dist-packages:/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/home/lussfer/catkin_ws/src/webots_ros/msg`

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 14:29:52
You should be able to just add one more path to the `PYTHONPATH` variable already present in th efile.

##### Lussfer 06/05/2020 14:28:00
> `@Lussfer` yes this is possible, however, you have to modify the runtime.ini file () to add the path to your custom ros message package path: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python/runtime.ini](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python/runtime.ini)

It will be included in the next version of Webots (and in the nightly build from tomorrow: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases))


thank you, let me check this

Can you share the exact parameters you are using for the crossroad?

##### nelsondmmg 06/05/2020 12:14:55
I'm trying to use the object Crossroad to create a T-intersection. When I enable bottom and bounding box the following error appears: 

webots2020a/projects/objects/road/protos/Crossroad.proto':56:28: error: Did not find a 'DEF CROSSROAD\_APPEARANCE' to match 'USE CROSSROAD\_APPEARANCE'.

Indeed, the object appears How can I solve this issue?

##### Luftwaffel 06/05/2020 11:58:09
okay, I'll have a look

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 11:56:54
You should get the 'children'/'endpoint' field of the current node, then get all the nodes in this field and do the same recursively on thoose nodes.

##### Luftwaffel 06/05/2020 11:56:03
how do I parse the node tree? I can't find the function for that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 11:46:21
Ok from a supervisor then, yes this is possible, but not so easy, you will have to parse the node tree from the supervisor and for each node you can check it's field.

##### Luftwaffel 06/05/2020 11:45:04
lets say I add a gripper to my robot arm. I give it a DEF. Can I extract all the motors contained in that gripper?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 11:44:16
What do you mean from a node? You want to get all the motors available in a robot from the controller?

##### Luftwaffel 06/05/2020 11:43:37
Is there a way to get all motors (or sensors) from a node? Without having to explicitly naming all of them?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2020 10:33:13
Yes indeed the model is quite simple and works better for low velocity, but it gives pretty realistic result for most of the underwater and flyign robots.

##### Luftwaffel 06/05/2020 10:21:16
I'm guessing the main application would be buoyancy and drag. But I'm guessing that is just approximations and for lower velocities? As proper CFD is quite complex and computationally intensive

`@Jorrock [no]` you can simply modify it in the scene-tree, or if the DistanceSensor is defined in a PROTO file you will need to manually edit the file.

##### lojik 06/04/2020 12:08:05
ok perfect, thank you üëç So I will check to change the timestep directly in .wbt files. This is the only one I change that seems to be done before loading the world.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 12:06:28
- worldInfo.timestep.  

- camera.width and height.

- Plugins (such as robot-window, physics plugins, remote-control).


Unfortunately not, however, as far as I rememeber, here are the main ones:

##### lojik 06/04/2020 12:04:56
Is there a list somwhere about these parameters? So I will be able to search them into my .wbt file before running it and change the others parameters after with getFromDef(). Instead of changing all my parameters.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 12:03:28
> Ok, nice I will check that. Thank you üëç 

You're welcome!

> If I understand it right, the simulation is consider as started as soon as we load a world file? This is why the timestep is consider as "fixed" by the supervisor?

`@lojik` yes, some of the parameters which should remain constant while the simulation is running (very few are like this actually) are transferred to the controller only when it is started (this will minimize communication between the controller process and the Webots process and therefore improve performance).

##### lojik 06/04/2020 12:01:49
Ok, nice I will check that. Thank you üëç 



If I understand it right, the simulation is consider as started as soon as we load a world file? This is why the timestep is consider as "fixed" by the supervisor?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 11:58:17
One possible solution, would be to have your controller 'write' your next world file (it can for example do a search and replace of the timestep value, or generate the world from a template), then your controller can use the 'wb\_supervisor\_world\_load' ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_world\_load](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_world_load)) function to load the new world.


Ok, in that case what you are trying to do might work (even so the controller is not receiving the update). But I would rather use another methd not changing the timestep after the controllers started.

##### lojik 06/04/2020 11:54:54
Is there an other way to do that? I do not would like to change the timestep in a simulation but between them.


My goal is to set the timestep with a constant in my controller parameters. So I can have some parameters in a python file and change them inside to influe the simulation. It will let me implement some grid search on parameters instead of changing them by hand for each simulations. I was thinking to set the world with these parameters and then do the steps simulation.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2020 11:51:19
Yes, it is not recommended to change the time step while the simulation is running, this can cause some instabilities.

##### lojik 06/04/2020 11:50:17
Hey everyone, I do not fully understand something. If I set a new basicTimeStep by doing :



sup.getFromDef('world\_info').getField('basicTimeStep').setSFFloat(param.BASIC\_TIMESTEP)



Then if I do a sup.getBasicTimeStep() after, it will return the old basicTimeStep and not the new one just set before.



Is it normal?

##### ThomasH 06/04/2020 09:55:12
Hi all! I have a question concerning the access to a node within a robot. I added a Camera to the existing iCreate Robot PROTO and now I want to use the C++ API to read out the position and orientation of the camera. This code is working to access the out Robot's node:

auto rootBot = m\_robo->getFromDef("ROBOT1");



However, I always get null when I try to access the camera node:

auto cameraSolid = m\_robo->getFromDef("ROBOT1.CREATE\_CAMERA");



Here is the relevant section of the PROTO file:

PROTO CreateLPR [

  ...

]

{

Robot {

  translation IS translation

  rotation IS rotation

  children [

      ....

    DEF CREATE\_CAMERA Camera {

`@Professor Felix`, do you mean the camera feedback in the view with a magenta border? This is called "Overlay" and should be enabled by default.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/03/2020 05:45:14
In Webots meshes are used for two purpose, for visualization (including sensors such as camera, lidar, etc.) and for the physics (basically collision detection). The first one is used when you specify it in a Shape node and the second one is used when you specify it in the boundingObject field of a Solid node.

`@David Mansolino` not sure what you are talking about. Are you asking if I set the meshes like in tutorial 2 with the ball? If so, I did not

`@dimple.bhuta` if you set it to local it just means that it will simply return X,Y,Z position in meter (which are the deviation from the reference point).

Ok


Ok but the coordinates arn't matching vehicle position. The reference that was generated using transforms and the car goes off-course.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/03/2020 05:37:07
In that case it is important to set the 'gpsReference' as it will define the latitude, longitude and altitude of the origin (0, 0, 0) of your simulation world.


if you set it to 'WGS84', then it will return the latitude, longitude and altitude of the GPS.


`@dimple.bhuta` if you set it to 'local' it will just return the X-Y-Z coordinate of the GPS in the Webots reference frame.

##### dimple.bhuta 06/03/2020 05:04:56
I tried that but it did not work

##### Clara Cardoso Ferreira 06/03/2020 05:04:31
Im not sure, but my guess is that the reference point is which coordinate do you want the gps to reference the robot, is it the center of the robot? if so, I think you want it to be 0,0,0?

How is dynamic friction handled in webots?  I can set the coloumbFriction, but what happens once it starts slipping? The dynamic friction coefficient is usually different than the static one.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 17:11:52
It's not yet possible, but we are working on that at the moment. So, you can expect to have this soon...

##### Luftwaffel 06/02/2020 17:08:54
If not urdf, perhaps .stl or .dae files


Is it possible to export a .proto in urdf format? For ROS the robot\_description is loaded into the parameter server, which IK software like MoveIT and tools like Rviz use. With robots that webots natively supports like the universal robots, the urdf used by ROS is different to the modified model in webots.


gotcha, thanks for clarifying

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 16:24:58
Yes.


But you are free to implement your own PID for velocity control.

##### Luftwaffel 06/02/2020 16:24:44
ah, but there is some form of PID controller in the engine then?! Otherwise that would cause troubles wouldnt it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 16:24:06
Yes, it relies on the direct velocity control of ODE which is very stable.

##### Luftwaffel 06/02/2020 16:23:28
does the velocity controller for the motor really not use PID?

Does webots use any GPU acceleration for simulation? Or just for rendering

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 15:18:48

The default time step of 8 or 16 ms works in many simulation setups and is way faster that 1 ms.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/02/2020 15:18:02
True, if your simulation is designed carefully, it should be 100% deterministic.


We modified ODE to produce better contact points that yields to a better stability. Also, we added fluid dynamics and multi-threading, fixed some collision functions, etc.

##### Luftwaffel 06/02/2020 15:17:02
Also, you use a fairly large default step time. of 8-16ms, compared to gazebo with 1ms. Is there any special sauce? I read and heared that you are 100% deterministic.

and just to confirm the ros controller you are refering to is the one that is located at `/usr/local/webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp` this location correct?


I was just getting feel of the webots


future functionality of the robot will be done through ros and currently my robots have basic functionlity

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/28/2020 14:54:53
But if you are not using ros to control the robot, why do you want to integrate ros ?


You can simply add an empty 'Robot' node and set the controller of this 'empty' robot to ros, this wqy, this robot can do the bridge between ros and your other robots

##### Rhino 05/28/2020 14:53:15
thank you `@David Mansolino`, I am using ROS1 infact. all my robots in the world already have set controller with set functionality. if i change one of their controller to ros how do i get the said robot's functionality back?

`@Rhino` are you using ROS1 or ROS2 ?

IF you are using ros1, you probably don't need to move anything, you simply need to assign the 'ros' controller to on of the robot of your simulation world.

But it will not completely stop the simulation. It will stop you controller and the behavior of the simulation is unpredictable when it stop itself.


You can have a variable like elapsedTime. You increment it with timestep for each basictimestep. And having a main while loop like :



while controller.step() != -1 and elapsedTime <= 2000:

sorry for more question but idk how to open that tar.zst file


alright

[http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86\_64/mingw-w64-x86\_64-opencv-4.3.0-2-any.pkg.tar.zst](http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/mingw-w64-x86_64-opencv-4.3.0-2-any.pkg.tar.zst)


So, you should download the same version from here: [http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86\_64/](http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/)

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 11:34:56
yeah i think it does

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 11:34:51
Maybe the package misses the gcc/msys2 lib files?


In MSYS2, they include these: [https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86\_64-opencv](https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-opencv)

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 11:34:17
i used the installer from the opencv website

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 11:33:38
How did you installed / compiled opencv?


and also libopencv\_core.dll.a to link with gcc


you should have libopencv\_core430.dll somewhere in your opencv installation.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 11:32:09
but the file doesnt exist into the opencv


yes i know

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 11:26:23
The libraries path is indicated by the `LIBRARIES` variable of the Makefile...

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:59:32
i cant find the files the make file wants me to have


i now get the following error


```C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Programs/Webots/msys64/mingw64/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/9.2.0/../../../../x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe: cannot find -lopencv_core430

```


oke i will thx

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:29:53
Check the INCLUDE variable from the Makefile (it should point to a folder with the necessary include files).

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:28:17
vision.cpp:29:10: fatal error: opencv2/core/core.hpp: No such file or directory

   29 | #include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>


`D:\username\Documents\opencv\build\x64\vc14\`


nope i changes the path i think that part works now

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:27:37
(or spaces)


Do you have non-ASCII characters in your username?

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:26:32
`D:/username/Documents/opencv`


yeah with c:/username  in front


`Documents/opencv/bin/opencv_version.exe: Command not found`

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:25:54
It should be an absolute path.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:25:39
`Documents/opencv`

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:25:34
(there are twice bin)

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:25:34
changed it to this


yes i guess

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:25:13
OK, it seems your path is wrong...


OK, Windows...


Are you on Windows, Linux or mac OS?

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:24:16
`Documents\opencv\build\bin/bin/opencv_version.exe: Command not found`


but i delete it so not eveeryone will see my path


yes i see but already did that

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:22:40
You should define the OpenCV installation path in `OPENCV_DIR` environment variable.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:22:18
```null :=
space := $(null) $(null)
WEBOTS_HOME_PATH=$(subst $(space),\ ,$(strip $(subst \,/,$(WEBOTS_HOME))))

include $(WEBOTS_HOME_PATH)/resources/Makefile.os.include

USE_C_API = true

# define the opencv installation directory if not set in an environment variable (tested with OpenCV 2.4)
#OPENCV_DIR =

ifneq ($(OPENCV_DIR),)
INCLUDE = -I$(OPENCV_DIR)/include/opencv4
ifeq ($(OSTYPE),windows)
OPENCV_VERSION := $(subst .,,$(shell $(OPENCV_DIR)/bin/opencv_version.exe))
LIBRARIES = -L$(OPENCV_DIR)/lib -lopencv_core$(OPENCV_VERSION) -lopencv_imgproc$(OPENCV_VERSION)
else
LIBRARIES = -L"$(OPENCV_DIR)/lib" -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc
endif
# Do not modify the following: this includes Webots global Makefile.include
include $(WEBOTS_HOME_PATH)/resources/Makefile.include
else
release debug profile clean:
    @+echo "# opencv not installed, skipping vision controller."
endif
```

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:21:37
Look into the Makefile to understand why it doesn't find your installation of OpenCV.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:21:19
ok but how to fix it

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:20:55
That means it doesn't get compiled.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:20:50
so i think he cant find opencv


thats the only error

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:19:45
What is the error message?

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:05:14
and a black cam


just the error

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 10:04:49
And can you compile the example?

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 10:04:09
but the example uses c++


when i search tutorials it also shows up like this when using version 4


yes i guess the controller is using also version 4

\#include <opencv2/core/core.hpp>

\#include <opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp>

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 09:58:23
Are you sure your controller is using the same version of python as the above?

i also put the opencv into path variables with 
```
D:\username\Documents\opencv\build\bin
```


so thats why its so strange


i also did that

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 09:46:59
Yes, or by typing make in a MSYS2 console.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 09:46:33
with the gearwheel

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 09:46:23
Then you need to recompile the robot controller.

##### Quantumfox 05/22/2020 09:46:22
so idk why its not working


i already did that

so can you help?


yes i did

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 09:41:36
You simply need to install OpenCV (see the Makefile of the robot controller)

hey guys i have a problem i get the following error when i try the vision demo

##### yash 05/22/2020 07:49:45
Okay , let me check it out . Thanks üëç

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 07:45:27
For the robot window, a good js plotting library is vis.js for example ([https://visjs.org](https://visjs.org)).


Yes, that's another option.

##### yash 05/22/2020 07:34:31
Alright , then what about the display node .?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 07:32:41
Then, you will have to use a HTML canvas or a js library.


See example  in `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/howto/worlds/custom_html_robot_window.wbt`.


`@yash`: you can use a robot window to plot your graph.


Then, you should debug your controller to understand where and why it crashes. You can use printf (and start Webots with the --stderr --stdout options) or use gdb: see [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/debugging-c-cpp-controllers)

##### yash 05/22/2020 07:26:59
I want to track the position of the robot in the environment. I am using odometry for this purpose. So I want to produce a graph of the robot path . How can this graph be plotted .?

##### kzooi 05/22/2020 07:18:51
`@Olivier Michel`: The controller.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/22/2020 06:46:41
See for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes#compound-solid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes#compound-solid)


`@chungshan`: You should avoid using complex meshes as bounding objects as they generate instabilities due to their complexity. Instead, you should create a composite bounding object made up of a Group node containing several Transform nodes. Each Transform should contain a translation, rotation and a children which should be a simple Shape (like a Sphere, a Capsule, a Box or a Cylinder).


`@riddlefive`: Please share a sample source code on your GitHub issue showing the problem.


`@kzooi`: is it your controller crashing or Webots? If Webots, please post a bug report on GitHub with all the information allowing us to reproduce the crash.


`@Troy`: you should increase the resolution of your Display device (width and height).


`@G1020BS`: This world file [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/howto/worlds/vision.wbt](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/howto/worlds/vision.wbt) is a demo of using OpenCV with a Webots controller. The controller itself and Makefile are located in [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/vision](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/howto/controllers/vision). This should help you.


`@jiang`: this floor is not "soft". The softness you seems to observe is due to the WorldInfo ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)) parameters. See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling#my-robot-sinks-into-the-ground-how-to-remove-this-effect](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling#my-robot-sinks-into-the-ground-how-to-remove-this-effect) for a solution to this problem.


`@Alfian`: the model is available here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/dji/mavic/protos/Mavic2Pro.proto](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/dji/mavic/protos/Mavic2Pro.proto)


`@ChapoGuzman`: you should proceed step-by-step to create a simple robotics arm, with only one joint at the beginning, then two, etc. Also, you should use simple primitives, like boxes, cylinders before importing 3D shapes from SolidWorks. That will help you understand how Webots models are implemented and you will be able in a later stage to import shapes from SolidWorks.

##### chungshan 05/22/2020 05:34:07
Hello, I import a vrml file to the webot. It is a bottle created in Solidworks. First, I convert this bottle to Solid node. I set the boundingObject to IndexedFaceSet of this bottle. However, the bottle is floating and it shows "WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep." How can I fix this?

Hi all, I am experiencing some issues when using the rangeImageGetDepth(image, width, x, y) function. 



I am currently using the Kinect proto node to detect an object through an RBG threshold. Using the x and y coordinates, I am trying to obtain the depth of that object through the rangefinder. The function seems to work fine for one iteration but it immediately crashes in the next loop. Does anyone know how I can fix this?

Hello guys, I designed a robotic arm in solidworks and I import it by v97 but I have problems to implement it as a "robot" I am new with the program and I have already read the tutorials and the user guide, there will be a diagram like this that I can follow to implement my parts in a single "robot" section

##### elkelkmuh 05/20/2020 15:33:25

`@David Mansolino` : That may be the problem.  I just loaded the original but local copy of the Tower\_of\_Hanoi world and the warning did not show.  (I'll debug it and come back.)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/20/2020 14:40:14
No you should not get it with the `void` controller.

Did you somehow saved the world after it has run?

##### nap 05/20/2020 14:38:14
> `@nap` this error simply means that the controllers send a position request that is slightly out of range of the motor.

`@David Mansolino` :  Should I get the warning when the controller is set to `void`? (In fact the warning seems to be issued before the world is ready to start executing after a reload.)

Can the warning be fixed by editing the PROTO?

For simulating fluid on the floor, where the objects are not immersed in it, I don't think that the Fluid node is the best option. I would rather display it on the floor like a graphical effect and then adjust the ContactProperties


Hi `@cakar`, the Fluid node is just a functional node and has no graphical appearance. You have to add the Shape node in the children field to visualize it. Here is a sample simulation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#floating\_geometries-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#floating_geometries-wbt)

##### cakar 05/20/2020 09:00:50

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/20/2020 08:50:20
> What is the best value for timestep and basictimestep? how should I determine?

`@elkelkmuh` by default 32 is used, but it is recommended to determine it by trial and error, basically try and as long as the simulation is not stable enough you can divide it by two.

##### PurplePi 05/20/2020 08:35:08
Thank you


I will try the emitter/receiver.


Yes but if I restart the robots controllers, I have to save the Neural Net 's parameters and reload again.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/20/2020 08:33:07
The other option to automatically notify them, is to restart the robots controllers.


> No I am not restarting the robots controller

`@PurplePi` Then you should use a IPC method (like using the Emitter/Receiver nodes) to let the Supervisor controller notify the robot controllers about the reset so that they can execute the initialization function.

##### PurplePi 05/20/2020 08:30:45
No I am not restarting the robots controller

Rotating the cube around its Y axis should give me sane values, but I actually get:

`@TheOrangeOne` I am sorry but can you be a bit more precise, what is the issue when rotating around the Y axis ? Can you provide an example? Using the axis angle you should not get any gimble lock.


> Hello everybody! Please help me write a PROTO of a wheel similar to the one in the screenshot. That is, the wheel rotates on an axis, and the axis with the wheel rotates in around the other axis. I couldn't figure out how to do this, so I replaced it with a sphere and a Hinge2Joint, whose anchor is located in the center of the sphere. This gave me the ability to move in two planes, but periodically triggers a warning "WARNING: The current physics step could not be calculated correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep"

`@Ronin52` to simulate this kind of wheel you usually have to use 2 HingeJoint instead of a Hinge2joint, here is an example: 

```
DEF CASTER_WHEEL_FRONT_RIGHT_JOINT HingeJoint {
  jointParameters HingeJointParameters {

    anchor 0.1695 -0.102 -0.0335

        }
      }
      ...

```

In any case, the warning that you are seeing just means that the physics engine encounter some instabilities, but in most of the cases if you just get a few of them you can ignore them.

`@nap` this error simply means that the controllers send a position request that is slightly out of range of the motor.

`@Olivier Michel`  Hi Olivier! Its highly likely that is what is happening in the simulation (large speeds, deep collisions, unstabilities). The GDB freezed webots right before crashing and I did not observed any warning in the console. Usually the 'WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.' happens during my simulation.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/19/2020 07:12:06
`@Luiz Felipe`: it could be that your simulation is reaching edge conditions for ODE, like very large speeds, deep collisions, unstabilities, etc. Do you get any warning in the Webots console before the crash?

The page says to start `gdb ./webots-bin` which is the executable and not the launcher (`webots` is the launcher).

but works. I think the path in the [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/troubleshooting](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/troubleshooting) troubleshooting page leads to the executable launcher?


I checked, it exists a 'webots' executable in /usr/local/webots folder and a 'webots-bin' in the /usr/local/webots/bin folder. Also correcting the libraries path to /usr/local/webots/lib/webots and running 'gdb ./webots-bin' again from my /bin folder it works. It shows the ERROR: Webots has not been started regularly. Please start Webots from its launcher.


If I run 'ls -la' the name of the executable is 'webots'. I tried to start gdb with 'gdb ./webots', 'gdb ./webots-bin'... I also tried to use 'file' inside the gdb to change the command but got the same error.

A video of how it works was posted on the link to instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVkbXNDKti/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVkbXNDKti/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). Everything is fine while the robot is moving. Please tell me what this may be related to? I also get this warning: "WARNING: The current physics step could not be calculated correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep"

Yes. You can compute it. For example if you are using the Rectangle arena, you can use the Supervisor API to get the `floorSize` and `floorTileSize`. Dividing the size by the tile size you get the number of tiles.

##### Conor 05/18/2020 16:00:23

`@taeyoung` have you tried using the min/maxPosition instead?


`@Rodeknopje` in that case you should use the `Robot.getInertialUnit` method ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=python#wb\_robot\_get\_device](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab-language=python#wb_robot_get_device)).

Good morning `@David Mansolino`;



I was going to create an issue in Github, but since I need to upload pictures, I am writing here.



I take error : Cannot load texture and Unsupported image format.



I switched to Linux. Authority problem ?



I'm using Linux Debian9 - Pardus 17.5

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/18/2020 06:30:55
`@dralorg` this might be due to the fact that the center of mass of the robot is not centered but rather to the front.


> Does any of the example use pure pursuit path follow algorithm by any chance?

`@Lussfer` here are some path plannign example in Webots: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27\_Robot\_Curriculum/Advanced\_Programming\_Exercises#Path\_planning\_](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27_Robot_Curriculum/Advanced_Programming_Exercises#Path_planning_)[Advanced]

> Hello, I'm working on a room-mapping robot for my final year project and was wondering if it is possible to get the grid that the robot is currently on? I'm trying to do a very basic 2d array as a topological map?

`@Conor` To get the position  of the robot you can use the GPS device or the Supervisor API. Both methods will give you the global 3D position, to map it to a XY grid map (or XZ using the default Webots coordinate system) you can simply discard the Y value.  I suggest you to check this sample simulation for an example about getting the robot position: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#gps-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#gps-wbt)

We are struggling with this sort of issue from a couple of weeks. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thanks

`@Jatin Sharma` hi, in webots you don't need to implement PWM, you can directly control the motors in speed or position, I would recommend to follow our tutorials (available in Python) to get familiar with controller programming in Webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-1-your-first-simulation-in-webots?tab-language=python)


> On webots i see that the object recognition is giving. X as Z, Y as Y and Z as -X. on webots does rotation match the orientations..

`@Mathie20` Yes the orientations match the 'rotation' field.

Abotu the axes inversion, I can't unfortunately reproduce this in the 'camera\_recognition' sample, do you have a specific case to reproduce this? Note that the position is expressed in the camera frame and not i nthe robot or world frame.

`@brianne.byer` sure, here is an example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot\_control/src/base.c](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot_control/src/base.c)

About the HingeJoint, you can indeed add them directly in the body slot as you would do with a regular chidren field (if not already done I would suggest to read this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot))


> hi there. if i use the supervisor to track the position of a robot. is it possible to send the position information to another controller?

Hi, I'm running the Youbots back wheels but the robot isn't moving. (The top wheels do make the robot move).



I've added the "contactProperties" inside the "WorldInfo" tag in the world file, this is what I've added.

  contactProperties [
    ContactProperties {
      material1 "InteriorWheelMat"
      coulombFriction [
        1.8, 0, 0.2
      ]
      frictionRotation -0.9648 0
      bounce 0
      forceDependentSlip [
        10, 0
      ]
    }
    ContactProperties {
      material1 "ExteriorWheelMat"
      coulombFriction [
        1.8, 0, 0.2

      bounce 0
      forceDependentSlip [
        10, 0
      ]
    }
  ]
```



Why the bottom wheels are not making the robot move?

Not to my knowledge.

##### Luftwaffel 05/13/2020 18:31:27
Is there any downside of running the webots controller in python 2.7 instead of python3?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 15:59:34
[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)


Doing that on github pages is an option indeed.


You simply need to publish the page anywhere on the web.

##### Rajesh Roy 05/13/2020 15:55:21
Alright, and how to do that?

Is there any way of doing it using GitHub?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 15:42:46
The tricks for Chrome and Firefox are only if you want to open the webgl page locally (with a `file://` URL). When you publish it on the web, e.g., with a `http(s)://` URL, you don't need these tricks.

##### Rajesh Roy 05/13/2020 15:41:25
Has anyone gone through the procedure of exporting your Webots file to a webgl file?


I want to know that isn't there any other option available? Since this part "--allow-file-access-from-files: turns your browser very vulnerable to attacks.



Also, do you have any idea of how to create a javascript block of code handling this to turn on and turn off automatically whenever calling the .html webpage?


I want to create a webgl based simulation which could just run like any other webgl application - "No add-ons, just the browser"

After referring to the materials provided on the documentation section, I found a paragraph saying



"

Chrome: launch with the --allow-file-access-from-files option

Firefox:

Open Firefox browser and in the address bar type about:config,

hit Enter button and click on I'll be careful, I promise!.

Search for privacy.file\_unique\_origin or security.fileuri.strict\_origin\_policy and double click on it to change the status from true to false.

`@Lussfer` In that case you have to convert them in your controller, here is the code in Webots that allows to make the conversion, you can probably take inspiration from it: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/565b5aed95a2aadb73bccf2ad733d37893d5edfe/src/webots/nodes/WbGps.cpp#L85-L106](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/565b5aed95a2aadb73bccf2ad733d37893d5edfe/src/webots/nodes/WbGps.cpp#L85-L106)


> `@David Mansolino` Thank you for your answer, I did not see this example. Unfortunately it does not work anymore if we put the basicTimeStep to 1ms. If I understand it correctly, it means that the physics behind the simulation has some errors due to a too high timeStep.

Probably yes, but I am not an expert in friction.

##### yash 05/13/2020 12:27:19
The thing is I can use that equation right .? If done properly


That‚Äôs what I used the value of friction calculated from the above equation

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 12:20:56
In that case the coulombFriction is probably too low

##### yash 05/13/2020 12:20:11

One more thing the wheels do rotate

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 12:09:18
Maybe you forget to take something else into account, like for example the wheel joint friction, etc.

##### yash 05/13/2020 12:08:15
The robot doesn‚Äôt move

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 12:07:56
What do you mean by 'it doesn't work', what is the behavior? And what is the desired behavior?

##### yash 05/13/2020 12:04:44
Because when I set the values calculated from above , it doesn‚Äôt work !


Sorry the equation should be  T = r*umg , where r = radius of wheel


My robot (differential drive) weighs 750gm , so according the torque required by each motor can be Calculated from T= umg, where u is the friction between wheels and rectangular arena, m is the mass of the robot , g is acceleration due to gravity.

So can I use this relation T= umg, to set the max torque in device parameters and the friction in contact materials?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 11:55:22
That is indeed possible, but you will have to write a Webots controller that will do the bridge between the simulated robot and the physical controller

##### Dobby 05/13/2020 11:41:29
We allready have a edited version of the thymio2 controller working perfectly and they wondered if they can somehow control it the same way but with a physical controller


Yeah! We work together with electrical engineers for our University project and they asked if it is possible to use this physical controller on the robot through a localhost with the use of JS

Thank you  for your help, so is it better to rebuild the table in webots rather than import a vrml file?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/13/2020 07:03:02
Hi `@Weiyi` Weiyi. This is probably due to the fact that your bounding object is an IndexedFaceSet. Depending on the resolution of the IndexedFaceSet (size of the triangles), this kind of problem may appear. I would recommend you to replace the IndexedFaceSet with primitives nodes such as a Plane or a series of Boxes which you can arrange inside a Group node that contains Transform nodes containing the Box Shapes, so that you can use as many boxes as you want at different positions.

##### Weiyi 05/13/2020 06:56:02
hello, I have imported an object from vrml file and I have added the bounding. When the robot is walking on it, sometimes the simulation is working wrongly so that the robot's foot goes under the surface of the table. This happens randomly, sometimes it works well but suddenly the situation occurs. I wonder how to fix this problem.

Ok, then it just means that the obstacle is too far compared to the default range of the distance sensor (which is by default 0.1m).

You can change it from the lookup table of the sensor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)

`@Rugnir` unfortunately object are visible only when you are outside of them so what you did is the only 'simple solution'. To have a better solution (but more complex to setup) you can once your viewpoint is below the surface of the water add a 'water plane' in front of the viewpoint (you will have to move the plane at each step so that it follows the viewpoint).

Not to a transform, but to a Solid node yes, the Supervisor can do this: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_add_force)

I also want to ask an another question.Is it possible to add an external force to a transform node?


Hello

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/12/2020 08:44:13
It might be possible to correct this in your other software directly (I am usign Blender for example and it is possible).


This just means that the points of the indexedFaceSet are not correctly centered around the origin of your node, but the origin of the node is still 0,0,0

##### Jeremy Jiang 05/12/2020 08:39:59
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean... The model created using other software is imported as a whole  and all the transform nodes in the model are all (0,0,0). For example, the transform node is exactly the cuboid in this picture. I created a ball on this cuboid, the position of the transform node should be exactly close to the ball. However, the position of the ball is about (0.33, 0.18, 1.68) while the node is (0,0,0).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/12/2020 08:28:18
Yes exactly. In that case it perfectly make sense to get (0,0,0) from the supervisor too. It seems the problem is more on your hierarchy side.

Hi `@Weiyi`, VRML is a graphical modeling language and doesn't have the notion of bounding object or physical properties, so it is not possible to import VRML models in Webots that already have bounding objects and physics properties set. But you have to set them directly in Webots.

`@Weiyi` there are different methods that you could use to model a barrier, here are a youple of suggestions:

1. passive: Add a big bounding object to the barrier and a DistanceSensor to the car that will detect it: when the barrier will be lifted the distance sensor value changes and the car can continue

2. active: add Emitter/Receiver nodes to the barrier and to the car that will communicate: the barrier could emit continuously a message indicating its status open/closed or the car could request the status when it approaches


`@Luftwaffel` usually the nightly build are available as compiled packages that you just have to download and install. Just click on the Assets drop down menu and pick your package: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

It can happen that some errors occur during the nightly build and thus some packages are missing for a particular day but usually all the packages are available.

The difference between the current two versions is that R2020a revision 2 contains is fixed version completely compatible with R2020a, and R2020b contains new features and changes that could break the compatibility with the previous version of Webots.


`@Aan` at the moment Webots doesn't have any microphone device to detect sound sources in a simulation. But it's already in our plan to add it.

However you could cheat and get the Speaker node (or any placeholder node for the sound source) position using the Supervisor API (for example [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=c++#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=c++#wb_supervisor_node_get_position))


`@Alejandro Pescathore` here you can find the detailed description of the friction approximation made by the physical engine ODE used by Webots: [http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Friction\_Approximation](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Friction_Approximation). Unfortunately I don't have any calibrated values for contact properties between rubber and wood.

Hi! I'm really new to webots. I'm trying to get better at the robotbenchmark task of Obstacle Avoidance, I have to use a braitenberg approach, I can't use any If-else statements. I was thinking on using reinforcement learning to tune the parameters. Two things, how can I stop the simulation and give the score like they to in robotbenchmark so like stop it if the robot crashes, crosses the line or takes longer than a minute 20. And also any advice or something to look for implementing reinforcement learning, don't have much experience in that either... Thanks in advance!

Hey I'm extremely new to robotics as well as webots. I'm curious as to how to modify a pre-existing robot (like youbot). I'd like to add distance and line sensors. Is that possible or is better to just start from scratch? I originally made my own but adding/find a claw was difficult. I'm assuming I can just add sensors by using #include \_\_\_\_\_\_ One of my main problems is simply adding lines for a robot to follow. Is there a video or possible tutorial that could help me? I've already visited the tutorials on the official site.

##### lojik 05/09/2020 16:21:17
But I am not totally convinced with this solution ..


Finally I obtained something not too bad with 0.8 as a friction coulomb and 0.001 as a forceDependentSlip (if it is smaller it produce non symmetric results)


`@Alejandro Pescathore` as I understand, on webots coulomb friction work as follow:

1. while there is no force bigger than <coulomb friction>*<normal force at this point> the two object will not slip pass each other

2. as soon as you have a force bigger than the one set with coulomb friction (in point 1.), you will have a speed equal to the <force acting on your object>*<forceDependentSlip cofficient set>



Coulomb friction coefficients bigger than one are physically correct.



But even with these informations I can not set a frottement that is physically satisfaying on my side too... Do someone has good tricks to have good results with a four wheeled robot turning on spot using differential wheels ? As soon as I test it on inclined plan it will just slip down the slope.

`@Olivier Michel` Thank you for both of your answers.

- I will take a look on the PID part to try finding why it is not working.

- So if I do not have the same result on each experiment I should have a look on my controller instead of webots ? There is no parameters inside webots that makes it non deterministic ?

##### Professor Felix 05/08/2020 15:58:08
thank you

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/08/2020 15:57:55
`@Professor Felix`: your approach seems good.


About determinism. Yes: Webots is deterministic. The same noise seed is applied when you run twice the same simulation, so that you should obtain the very same results. If you want it to be non deterministic, you can simply have your controller wait for some random amount of time (using a time-based seed) before starting to move the robot and you will get non-reproducible results.


`@lojik`: the PID control is performed here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/webots/nodes/WbMotor.cpp#L248-L260](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/src/webots/nodes/WbMotor.cpp#L248-L260). I would recommend you to recompile Webots from the source and add some printf statements here, so that you can better understand what's wrong with your approach.

##### Professor Felix 05/08/2020 15:49:49

Hello everyone, I am new on this discord.



I'm using webots on a master project and have some questions :

- I am trying to overshoot my webots PIDs without realistic success. Is it better to implement a custom PID in the controller directly or could I missed something in the simulation that makes my webots PIDs unrealistic ?

- Are the simulation with webots deterministics or there is always some noise automatically added to make them more realistic but not deterministic ?



Thank you in advance for your help. I can provide parameters if it is needed to better understand my questions.

I checked your simulation, the biggest issue I see is that the weight of the 'BEAM\_BASE' solid is extremely big. I assume this is to simulate the fact that it is part of the ground and can't move ?

Instead of using a very heavy mass, it is better to set the endpoint of the joint to be a 'SolidReference' node and to set the name to ``<static environment>`, this way the end of the joint will be locked to the environment: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference)

because in the main window with the world file name it is written 'No Project'


may be this is because I dont have a project just only .wbt file and protos folder


this happens to all other protos to my working directory as well


proto name is consistent as the file name and in the deifnition


no its a dummy just for the sake of info

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/06/2020 16:24:01
Your proto is named "robot"?

any insights on this issue


ERROR: '/home/tahir/mbs\_robot/mbs\_models/robot\_v1.wbt':15:1: error: Skipped unknown 'robot' node or PROTO.


My webots world is behvaing strange.

I have a robot proto node which is in protos folder. When I insert the proto in the world everything works fine. When I reload/restart webots I get error and the proto is not present in the scene treen. If I convert it in base node or insert Webots proto everythings work fine.

let me have a look again

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/06/2020 14:34:14
Did you follow this tutorial: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot) and the previous one to understand how to define the mechanical structure of a robot?


The next thing to check is the joint structure of your robot.


If you didn't set anything here, it should be OK.


It's based on the density information and the bounding object.

not really, as described in the documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation): the `wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation` functions returns tthe rotation of the node in the global world coordinate system and as a 3x3 matrix

Ok, in that case the simplest solution is probably to un-prototize the robot (right click on the robot->`Convert to Base Node(s)`), this way you will be able to access the `position` field of the robot from your supervisor and change them at the first step after the reset.

##### LaCava 05/04/2020 10:35:47
It's a NAO v5, straight from the PROTO

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 10:35:16
No problem. To move the joints position is a bit more tricky. First, is your robot a PROTO node or noe?

##### LaCava 05/04/2020 10:34:05
Sorry for the ambiguity there


(By position, I mean joint angles, not XYZ space)


Is there a way to specify the position when loading the world, or is that fixed? Otherwise, I'll just move it, thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 10:32:22
Hi `@LaCava`, the position is reset at the position it was when loading the world. However, you can from your supervisor move your robot where you want at the first step after resetting the simulation.

##### LaCava 05/04/2020 10:30:25
Hi -- I've searched in the channel, but haven't been able to find anything specific: is there a way to change the default position of a robot after a call to `simulationReset` with a supervisor? I'd like to have the robot begin in a specific pose during training of a RL agent

`@David Mansolino` :  Ok, I've used `wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_rotation`, added a delta to the angle, fourth indice ([3]), and then used `wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_rotation`.  The results were promising at the start but then the circle turned into a spiral.

%end


Ok, I'll try that.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 05:58:52
Oh ok I see, this is because you are using `wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation`  which returns a rotation matrix ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation)), you should probably use the rotation field instead:

`wb_supervisor_field_get_sf_rotation(rotField);`

This is probably the reason why you have to multiply by `index` too.

##### nap 05/04/2020 05:55:44
> About the orientation, it seems from your code that you are correctly rotating around the Y axis and not Z, I am not sure what you mean Z axis orientation (in Webots the up axis is Y).

`@David Mansolino` you will notice I'm using the indice "2" not "1".

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/04/2020 05:54:57

> `@David Mansolino` : I've implemented a Supervisor that rotates the epuck every 10 time\_steps.  In the attached screenshot, I have the trail marked (using the the webots trail example supervisor but with more data points) and my 'noise' code (basically all of it is visible in the image).  The noise at the moment increments the CW rotation of the epuck on each step, while the epuck thinks it's going straight.  However, the result is confusing me.

However, I need to multiply the noise by the number of iteration otherwise the epuck travels in a straight line after the initial deviation.

> 3) Is the rotation function using ARCTAN?  I don't think so, because the epuck does achieve more than 360 degrees of rotation.  However the path, in my mind should have been a circle rather than a weird spiral.

`@nap` it is indeed strange that you have to multiply by index, can you try printing the value of the rotation you get (I do suspect that you get the value of one step before and therefore before the increment).

study the proto for the e-puck and experiment.   You will get it. (I don't have to the time to make an example for you.)


when  you edit your robot's proto, note that there is a node in the structure under "children" but there is also a reference in the interface section (fields)

##### pheonixash 05/04/2020 03:22:15
`@nap` sorry I m not getting how to do

##### nap 05/04/2020 03:21:42
`@pheonixash` : edit the proto of your robot and add the same node that the e-puck proto has.  Then, into that node, add the E-puckGroundSensor.

##### pheonixash 05/04/2020 03:20:04
`@nap`  yup there is an attachment for groundsensor in epuck but I want to add ground sensor in some other robot which I created so how can I do that

##### nap 05/03/2020 23:22:24
`@lshil` there could be a number of things going wrong here.  You have to explain more clearly what you are trying to do.


`@pheonixash` : The epuck has a attachment point called `groundSensorSlot` in its interface (expand the epuck node in the LHS panel.  You need to add `E-puckGroundSensors` to this node.

When you change the floor size, your texture is scaled up/down accordingly. You should set the dimensions of your arena and then create the texture with the appropriate line widths.  (floorSize and floorTileSize work together.)

You should not change the size of the E-puck.  It will simply look smaller if you make your world larger.


`@David Mansolino` :  There is something strange going on here.  In the attached image, I'm adding a relative torque to the epuck's body every 10 steps.  If I add 0.05 (lower portion of the image), the robot starts turning left for a few steps (may be just one) but then continues straight.  However, if I add 0.06 (top part), the robot performs the path I mentioned in my post above, square with arced sides.

Hi `@dralorg`, the simplest solution is to temporarily convert the Youbot node in Base nodes (you can do this by right-clicking on the Youbot node in the scene-tree), this way you will be able to select the wheels in the scene-tree and read their position in 'position' tab of the nod editor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor)

In the `UR3` PROTO node, there is a `staticBase` which is TRUE by default, in you case you have to set it to FALSE ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure#field-summary)).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/01/2020 13:33:59
The floor is supposed to be a static object so it should never move. Since the robot is quite heavy, have you tried changing the contact properties ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)) ?

Basically setting the `softCFM` to a lower value (e.g. 1e-05), the `coulombFriction` to a higher value (e.g. 5 to 10) and the WorldInfo.ERP to a higher value (e.g. 0.6).

Decreasing the time step may also help (e.g. to 10ms).

The print functions didn¬¥t work either, and the loop of the controller was messed up, it changed the colours, but did not record the videos. But that could be because the robot was embedded in the middle of a table


the main issue was that the position of the robot did not reset, but stayed right where it was when the method was called, it was only the joint angles that reset.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 15:04:33

Hi, I'm trying to use the simulationReset() method of the Supervisor, but it makes the  my world go crazy.  I'm supposed to record a sequence of motions as videos, then resetting the simulation at the end of the motion, changing some variables (the colour of the robot), and then recording again, multiple times. When resetting, the variables do not reset, and the inner loops that change the variables go nuts and out of sequence, and the robot does not get reset to the right location either. Any suggestions?

Yes this is possible, it is not very easy, you have to change the default orientation of the Solid node in the `endPoint`  field of the joint.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 09:39:20
I see, this is because of the plane primitive which is used as the bounding object of the floor proto. In that case, if you need different levels, you should probably create your own rectangle arena proto which uses a Box instead of the Plane for the floor.

##### Greenhigh 04/30/2020 09:37:28
for example if you have two rectangle areana's at diffrent height. It seems like any object can not go below the top most areana. They just float in the air. Sort of difining the world hight since the objects cant go below the top areana?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2020 09:34:08
Yes. But what do mean by "world height"? Each rectangle arena will have it own height.

##### Greenhigh 04/30/2020 09:32:40
Is it possible to have multiple Rectangle Areana's in the same world where only one of them defines the world height?

Yes, from a supervisor

I can retrieve the correct "pointer" on that field, but when I try to modify its values, it doesn't seems to work

`@Alejandro Pescathore` I would recommend to have a look at this simple example that can indeed rotate: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#track-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#track-wbt)


> `@David Mansolino` Yeah it's set to true in the launch file

`@Lars` ok, then you probably have to go for simpler bounding object, because the ros interface doesn't like indeed when the simulation runs was slower than real time


It all depends on how you plan to control it.

If you want one central control then one single robot is better. But if you want to have one control algorithm for the base and one for each arm then it is better to have one Robot for the base and one sub-robot for each arm (this is my favourite solution, but again it all depends on what you want to do). Not also that if you use the ROS interface for example, one robot per arm is better.

I have one robot base with a frame. I want to mount three UR arms on it. 

what is better hierarchy for Webots. All arm nodes inside the robot base node or 4 separate robot nodes (3 arms and 1 base) and than mounted on base

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 10:15:43
Did you set the use\_sim\_time parameter to true?

##### Lars 04/29/2020 09:33:10
`@David Mansolino` With `basicTimeStep = 4` the test world runs at about half real-time speed and most of the fruits are doing alright aside from one of the lemons. Reducing the time step to 1 everything works fine, but it only runs at 1/10th of real time.

But in the world with the robot system I think this would be problematic as we have issues with ROS synchronization,  the clock resets all the time and giving us warnings (e.g. `Moved back in time (probably because ROS clock was reset)`)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 09:14:25
`@Lars` have you tried drastically reducing the world time step?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 09:12:10
Yes, but with a complex combination of spheres of different sizes and capsules of different lengths and diameters, I am sure you can achieve a pretty precise bounding object for most fruits.

##### Lars 04/29/2020 09:10:07
`@Olivier Michel` Thanks, that's what I was anticipating, but I was hoping it would be something different. The complexity was somewhat needed to emulate real world use case of grasping these types of fruits.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 09:02:19
`@Alex123`, not as I know, but there are sample for getting the value from the sick sensors, then if you want to save them to a file you can simply do this as you would do in any regular program (Webots controllers are regular program).

##### Alex123 04/29/2020 08:59:53
hello,I want to know that is there any ready sample for collecting data of sick's sensors in webots

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2020 08:48:30
Yes, I suspect that bounding object made up of small but complex meshes are responsible for such a behavior. I would recommend you to avoid IndexedFaceSet for the bounding objects and use instead a combination of simple primitives (such as spheres, capsules and boxes).

##### Lars 04/29/2020 07:59:33
For reference the left-most banana, green apple and orange are standard fruits from WeBots itself and they work just fine like some of the other fruits I implemented.


I'm observing some strange behavior of my fruits in WeBots. Physics and BO is defined for all of them, but some move right through the surface they are put on as shown in the video. I've tried different physics settings such as removing mass and changing it for density, added intertia matrix, dampening, etc.

Does it all come down to the bounding object and being too complex? Especially the grapes is a bad one I think.

You may change the Webots preference file before starting Webots using a script.

`@adaptive`: I would recommend you get rid of anaconda version and try to install Python 3.8 cleanly.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 04/28/2020 09:52:43
I have a robot model(Clearpath Robotics Warthog) and three Universal Robot Arms(2 UR3 and 1 UR5) all at front. each UR3 weighs 11.2 kg and UR5 20.6 kg. UR3's are on the side and UR5 is in the the middle of both UR3's. The robot can travel at a speed of 18 km\hr. 



I want to check the stability of the platform at lower as well as higher speeds in two configurations. One as shown in the figure(UR 5 a little behind 2 UR3's) and another one when the all are inline at the front.



The desired one is the second configuration where all arms are at the front and inline to give maximum area for manipulation.

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 09:51:04
I have mkl-service installed, but nothing changes


Ok, i changed the alias to "py" and now occurs this message [https://bpaste.net/CVLQ](https://bpaste.net/CVLQ) .. If Im running py in an cmd i get that the base isnt activated (i have activated it)


But if I open an CMD, and type "python" -> Microsoft Store opens and want me to install py 3.8^^


this is what I get if I run python out of the dir


"Warning:

This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has

not been activated.  Libraries may fail to load.  To activate this environment

please see [https://conda.io/activation](https://conda.io/activation)"


oh man, what a mess, Vscode uses 3.7.6 (installed with conda), in my PATH i declared the path to python in conda dir which is the 3.7.6

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 09:14:22
Can you also print the Python version in your working vscode example using numpy?


And are you sure numpy was installed for this version?

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 09:12:56
the same as yours, [slave] 3.8.2 (tags/v3.8.2:7b3ab59, Feb 25 2020, 23:03:10) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]


using numpy in vscode is no problem, so the package is definitely installed

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 09:12:29
Which version of Python is displayed by your controller?

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 09:10:36
but the problem is still there, if i include numpy in slave.py, it is not found


I copied the project into my private directory and it seems to work now.. thanks for your patience^^

Python doesn't need to build as it's not a compiled language like C or C++.

Put it at the end of the `__init__` method. Before that the interface with Webots is not initialized and print commands don't land in the Webots console.

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:52:31
Yes, the command is defined


I have inserted the code befode defining the class Enumerate, saved it and pressed the "run" button, but in the console there is no output

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:51:44
Also check that the Python command is set to "python" in the Webots preferences.

It may be simpler to start from the `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt` sample world and edit the `slave.py` controller for example.


Simply create a robot that uses this controller.

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:48:06
I created a new project and inserted the code into an new controller, but how do I execute it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:45:01
Can you print the Python version from your controller program to check it is the same?

```

print (sys.version)
```

Ok that explains the problem, the support of Python 3.8 in Webots on Windows is not supported in R2020a-rev1, it will be in the next version of Webots. You can get a beta of the next version (R2020a-rev2) including Python 3.8 support on Windows by downloading a nightly build here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:15:22
But since you installed python 3.7 it seems it is using python 3.7 and therefore numpy is not installed for 3.7.

About python 3.8, which version of Webots are you using and on which OS ?

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:14:00
Numpy and any other lib is installed for 3.8

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 08:13:01
Is the 'numpy' module installed?

``python3.7 pip-m install numpy``

##### adaptive 04/28/2020 08:12:15
Hello, i have a problem getting webots running python. I have installed python 3.8 (anaconda) and started webots "Python 3.7 not found" -> installed Python 3.7 -> "No module named 'numpy'" ..

Or use the `--mode=pause` command line argument.


Yes, you can select the startup mode from the Webots Preferences (pause mode).

##### Dorteel 04/28/2020 06:35:14
Is there a way to start up WeBots without autostarting the simulation? That seems to be why it¬¥s crashing


No, it just prints the line a couple timesteps in the motion.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/28/2020 06:32:53
If you don't create the movie, but issue a print statement when the motion is over, does it work as expected?

##### Dorteel 04/28/2020 06:29:38
Hi, can you help me with recording a movie with the Supervisor? I have multiple problems, my idea was to see if the motion is over and stop the video recording. However the Motion.isOver returned true in the middle of the motion. I tried to comment out the video creating lines but I keep getting the error that the "Nothing was recorded because the simulation didn¬¥t run" even though there is no line to make a recording. I get the warning at every timestep.



EDIT: I tried restarting WeBots, but now it just starts up and crashes instantly without a warning.

`@Luftwaffel` looks like a good approach. For the supervisor, you can get the absolute position of both nodes and the compute te difference

##### Luftwaffel 04/27/2020 14:14:10
right now my approach is to us the tf library to use kinematics tree transformation to calculate the toolslot position using the published tf topic. seems like uneccesary extra work. Is it possible to get that data directly?


now the controller is crashing... hmm perhaps I should do extra ros stuff outside of webots.... On a different note, is it possible to get positions (using supervisor) relative to a specific frame? I want to get the gripper position relative to the robot base, not the world


the ROS\_PACKAGE\_PATH= also has to be appended, for it to work

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 14:04:15
> shouldn't this line in the runtime.ini

> PYTHONPATH=$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/lang....

> be this:

`@Luftwaffel` yes if you want to preserve the ``PYTHONPATH`` (in our case as we don't want that a possible ROS installation on the computer cause conflicts we don't want to preserve it).

##### Luftwaffel 04/27/2020 13:55:33
good news, altering the runtime.ini works, bad news, tons of other errors. will investigate and post results


this would automatically add the stuff installed on the system


shouldn't this line in the runtime.ini

PYTHONPATH=$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/lang....

be this:

PYTHONPATH=$(PYTHONPATH):$(WEBOTS\_HOME)/projects/lang....

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:48:27
Yes you can edit it per project, you just have to edit the runtime.ini file associated with your controller.

##### Luftwaffel 04/27/2020 13:45:45
I am using a edited version of the universal\_robot\_ros controler, which is in its own git repository, not in the webots install


can I edit this on a per project basis, or do I have to alter the install?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:43:28
The ROS controller of the UR robots is using the version of the python ROS libraries distributed in Webots (which doesn't include TF), this is defined (and can be changed) here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/runtime.ini](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/runtime.ini)

##### Luftwaffel 04/27/2020 13:43:07
and if so, where?


do I have to do that for webots too?


In my .bashrc I have to include the source commands to add the paths

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:42:10
No we are using python2 for ROS controllers

are you using a python3 compiled ros?

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 13:12:32
ok thank's

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 13:11:10
You may use a touch sensor on the robots.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 13:10:22
like a colision signal


Me again with an other question:

Is there a way to know when 2 robots touch each other ? or only by notifying the position of each and see when they are near each other ?


ok thank's very much üòâ

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:36:04
Exactly.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:36:01
?


something like :

Supervisor {

controller "my\_supervisor"

}

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:34:16
No. But it's very simple. Just create a Supervisor and if it has no children (default), then it is invisible.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:33:31
is there a tuto or any doc who is showing an efficient way of creating an invisible supervisor process ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:26:21
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:25:49
having an invisible supervisor process do I have to creat it into the world file .wbt ?


ok thank's how can I do that the more efficient possible ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:24:54
So, it's probably better in your case to have an invisible supervisor process logging everything.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:24:52
and one or two with a lot more parameter then position


position


I've got a lot of robots to log

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:24:09
It depends on your need.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:23:43
is it not better to do that then doing a log in every robot ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:23:28
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:23:12
is it possible to creat in webot an invisible robot or object with a controller that can log everything ?


ho I've got a last question:


have a nice day I think it's all for me today üôÇ


haha nice cool thx

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:08:49
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:08:38
but I say "WorldInfo" and "title" for field ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:08:12
Yes.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:08:08
it's like a position

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:08:02
As you would get any other field of any node.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:08:02

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:07:43
You can get it from a supervisor controller.

Is there a way to get the simulation name from a controller ?


I've got an other question for you ^^


ok thank's ^^


I'm trying to do an anylizer of simulation and I will run like 20k short simulation, I would like not to see any of them

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:03:48
Yep.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 12:03:16
that's the more silent webots can do ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 12:01:59
Actually, your should probably combine `--minimize`, `--batch` and `--mode=fast`.


There is `--minimize` mode, that will open a iconified window.

##### Psyka 04/27/2020 11:59:53
on windows I mean


?


Hello everyone :)

I've seen that there are some launching "mode" like "run" "pause" "fastrun" or "realtime", I've tried them but is there a silent mode where webot doesn't launch any visual just working like a hidden process

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 11:45:01
Actually physics plugin are more and more outdated, the Supervisor API is getting so powerfull that it offers almost all the features fo the physics plugin (and is much more simple/stable).

##### nap 04/27/2020 11:28:39
`@David Mansolino` : I could, but I figured using a physics plugin was the more natural way of doing it.  And to be honest, now that I've invested the time, I would like to work out why I'm having these problem.  Otherwise, I'll need to go through the learning curve again next time I attempt a physics plugin.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 10:43:47
`@nap` why not simply changing the robot rotation using the Supervisor API instead of doing it from a physics plugin?

##### nap 04/27/2020 09:38:35
`@David Mansolino` :  You won't believe it, but I'm still stuffing around with the motor/wheel noise.  I'm using `dRFromAxisAndAngle` to rotate a small amount left/right and then `dBodySetRotation` .  However, it looks to me that on each step, my previous rotation is 'undone' and the `dBodyGetRotation` is back to its original course.

I tried using Force and Torque (as well as Rel) as you originally suggested, but I have to apply such high values to overcome the coulombFriction that when the epuck finally alters it course, it flies away wildly.

Should I use Kinematics mode?  Any other suggestions?

##### pro2017001 04/27/2020 09:31:49

##### nap 04/27/2020 08:53:28
`@Olivier Michel` : yes, from my controller it works fine.  Not sure why it didn't work from the physics plugin, but I'm not going to worry about that for now.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 08:52:37

In that version `printf("\f");` should work, isn't it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 08:46:02
On the nightly builds, you can use the ANSI control code to clear the console.

##### nap 04/27/2020 08:44:52
Is there a way to clear the console from code?  `printf("\f\n");` used to do that, but doesn't seem to do so anymore?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 04/27/2020 08:20:05

> I am using gyro to turn my robot at certain degree but the problem is when I want it to stop at the particular amount of degree my robot won't stop

`@nikzzzlegrande` you set the position of the right motor to 0. But are you sure your motor is currently at position 0? And in any case as you exit right after sending the command without performing any robot step, the command is actually never sent to Webots.

P.S: next time use  screen shot instead of camera.

`@machinekoder` very nice demo!

Are you speaking of the warning you get in the console about the physics step?

To get AND change them you will need to use the Supervisor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

You're welcome

##### SR-CNA 04/24/2020 14:56:25
`@David Mansolino` Thank you, I will go through the example you provided.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/24/2020 14:52:47
`@SR-CNA` yes, this is possible, for this you will have to create a PROTO of the plane and use procedural PROTO to define randomly the color.

I strongly advice to follow our tutorial about PROTO (and the previous one) if not already done: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

This is for creating a simple non-procedural PROTO, then you should read the documentation about procedural PROTO: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

And finally, you can find here an example of procedural PROTO: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ad933d92210f17f784807cb33741ab4dc41d684f/projects/objects/factory/pallet/protos/WoodenPalletStack.proto#L22](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/ad933d92210f17f784807cb33741ab4dc41d684f/projects/objects/factory/pallet/protos/WoodenPalletStack.proto#L22)

##### SR-CNA 04/24/2020 14:48:34

Hi `@XZbot`, yes you can make a wall appears using the Supervisor API (the simplest solution is to have the wall already present in the simulation and simply move it with the supervisor): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

About multiple run, please find some explanation about numerical optimisation with Webots here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

##### XZbot 04/24/2020 09:54:38
Hi `@David Mansolino` , I have two questions regarding the Webots environment. (1) I put an e-puck inside a triple T-maze constructed by walls. When it passes some T-intersection, I would like to temporarily block its way back so that it has to explore the unvisited area. I am not sure if a one-way door can be applied in this case, which means the e-puck can push the door from one direction but not the other, so that it won't go back after passing the door. Or can I make a door/wall suddenly appear at the intersection after the e-puck passes it during simulation? Or do you have some better suggestion?  (2) Can I run multiple simulation trials parallelly (at the same time) in the fast mode and how?  Thanks a lot!

Hello, I've been working with Webots for almost a year now and I feel very happy with the software and the community support. You guys rock!

As part of my Master Thesis at ULB I am working on the subject: "Machine Learning for Probabilistic Robotics with Webots" and I developed a Particle's Filter algorithm together with a visualisation plugin that I would like to share with you. A very small demo can be found on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fISDutZca5g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fISDutZca5g) and the code is here: [https://github.com/joangerard/webots-thesis](https://github.com/joangerard/webots-thesis) 

I am still working on the documentation part. Hopefully I will finish it by the end of next month. 

Is there anyone working on a similar subject?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/23/2020 14:43:36
To test this you can try to add the ur10e proto to your world using the add node dialog, you will see that the one in your project is available but the one in the Webots installation directory is grey and not addable.


Webots will load in priority the PROTO from the ``protos`` folder of your project and then (if it didn't find them) in the Webots installation directory.

##### Luftwaffel 04/23/2020 14:38:05
`@David Mansolino` Quick question, how does a worldfile know, which .proto to load? I had to make a change to the ur10e.proto, and it made me save it in my project location instead of altering the original (totally fine). However, the .wbt file does not change. Where is the link to that file stored? I'm asking, because I'm working on a group project, and our git does not include the webots install

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/23/2020 07:51:34
There is no notion of language, you have to add the sensor in the Webots scene-tree, then to use them you should do like with any other distance sensors, here is an example in Python: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=python#the-controller-code](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab-language=python#the-controller-code)

Actually the names are documented just a bit after: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#devices-names](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#devices-names)


`@Huey`, their name are indeed not documented ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck-characteristics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck-characteristics)), but the names are `gs0`, `gs1` and `gs2`, and they work the exact same way than the other distance sensors.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/23/2020 05:22:48
`@yxc1280`: a controller program should usually not `sleep()` as this will block the simulation process id the controller is synchronous. Instead you probably want to use the `wb_robot_step()` function and specify the duration as an argument (expressed in milliseconds). During this amount of time, the simulation will progress but your controller will do nothing.


`@Psyka`: you should use supervisor to track down the positions of objects and store them in your own custom log file.

##### dmknuth 04/22/2020 20:11:21

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 13:27:07
The focal distance is the distance to the focusing plane.

And the focal length is the distance from the optical centre of the lens to the sensor. Bigger this value is, larger the sharp area is.

##### Greenhigh 04/22/2020 13:26:33
Focal length should that be kinda of a zoom. Like to detimine how much of the image will be captured in the field of view?


Shouldnt it just be one varible?


So that is the diffrence between focal distance and focal length?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 13:10:17
In Webots, the focal length and the FOV are not coupled you can change the FOV using the `fieldOfView` field of the camera.

##### Greenhigh 04/22/2020 13:08:01
I dont know if im doing it wrong but I tried to add the focal node and set a focal length. So now i can select a focal distance and focal length. but whenever i choose some values it changes focus as exspeted. but shouldnt the FOV change aswell?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/22/2020 12:12:28
Hi `@Greenhigh`  To calibrate the camera, you can add a Lens node to the camera to calibrate the distortion ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lens](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lens)) and a Focus node ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus)) to define the focal length (here is a demo with auto-focus: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHUt6ifcHfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHUt6ifcHfU))

Hello everyone,



I've got an issue when I try to launch any simulation with a windows cmd I've got a message telling : "File not found: 'C://resources/qt\_warning\_filters.conf'."

and most of my textures doesn't show up, I've been searching for help everywhere, I know that the path given is wrong it should be : "C://Program Files/Webots/resources/qt\_warning\_filters.conf" but I Don't know where I could make this change. If someone can help me it would be cool.

Another option is to add a Display ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display)) device to your robot and display there whatever you want.


Basically your robot window is a web page which may include some JavaScript code and open a dialog box.

##### Darko Lukiƒá [cyberbotics] 04/20/2020 18:57:05
`@Luftwaffel` Oh, odometry is usually used in the context of mobile robots. I didn't know you use industrial robots. `tf` is a package that you want to check out. `tf` allows you to get transformation (translation and rotation) between any two links in a transform tree. 



To see all available published transformations, you can use:

```
rostopic echo /tf
```

This is one of many ways, you can use e.g. RViz or check the following page for more examples:

[http://wiki.ros.org/tf](http://wiki.ros.org/tf)



As mentioned, `tf` can calculate any transformation in the given transform tree, so you can use:

```
rosrun tf tf_echo [link_1] [link_2]
```

so, e.g. you can can obtain transformation between `upper_arm_link` and `wrist_1_link` as:

```
$ rosrun tf tf_echo /upper_arm_link /wrist_1_link
At time 152.976
- Translation: [0.000, -0.137, 1.184]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.707, 0.000, 0.707]
            in RPY (radian) [3.142, 1.571, 3.142]
            in RPY (degree) [180.000, 89.998, 180.000]
At time 152.976
```



How to code it? With an understanding of everything above it is relatively easy to code. Please check an example here:

[http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28C%2B%2B%29](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20listener%20%28C%2B%2B%29)



Hope this helps.

How can i get the position and orientation relative to a different frame? I dont want it relative to the world. In the GUI I can select it, but I want to set it by code.


with the orientation being in quaternion

using ROS1 sadly

##### Darko Lukiƒá [cyberbotics] 04/20/2020 16:20:17
`@Luftwaffel`  If you use ROS2 than you can use `WebotsDifferentialDriveNode` in your ROS2 driver. You can check a good example of `WebotsDifferentialDriveNode` usage here:

Hi, is there a simple way to publish the odometry into a ros topic from within webots?

I suppose I should calculate the X-Z angle.


I get the bot's current orientation using  `dBodyRobotRot = (dReal *) dBodyGetRotation(gRobotBodyID);`

##### Luftwaffel 04/19/2020 15:02:40
for rotating a bot, it usually makes sense to use its own frame

##### nap 04/19/2020 15:02:35
At least that's what I want to do.


So, I get the orientation, add a small yaw and then set the new orientation.


and can be used in dBodySetRotation


From the docs, dBodyGetRotation return world coords.

##### Luftwaffel 04/19/2020 15:01:00
everything depends on your reference frame. Usually every joint and the world have their own coordinate systems, and it is not always clear, which way they 'point'

##### nap 04/19/2020 15:00:24
(Thanks for your suggestions though.)


I'm  not new to 3D transformations, it's just that I don't use them everyday, and there are things happening in Webots which don't seem to make sense.  Like, when my epuck is facing up the screen (-Z), I can make it yaw by using  `dRFromAxisAndAngle(R,0.0,1.0,0.0, dBodyRobotRot[2] - angleDeltaBase);` followed by `dBodySetRotation(gLeftWheelBodyID,R);`

However, when I have the epuck facing Left on the screen (-X), I cannot use the same formula.  It doesn't make sense because I'm still performing a yaw.

##### Luftwaffel 04/19/2020 14:58:37
An incredible link to understand Quaternion is this: [https://eater.net/quaternions/](https://eater.net/quaternions/)


it is not 100% necessary to understand it, but it certainly helps. There is conversion libraries, to convert things like rotations from one form into another. The 3 most commonly used rotation notations are Quaternion (x,y,z, w). Euler Angles and 3x3 Rotation matrix. They all have andvantages and disadvantages


it is linear Algebra. The math is the same, no matter what software you use

##### nap 04/19/2020 14:51:25
(and ODE?)


`@Luftwaffel` :  Thanks.  I will read it.  Does the tutorial use the same conventions as Webots?

##### nap 04/18/2020 12:26:57
Can someone please explain the 4x3 matrix returned from a call to `dBodyGetRotation`?  I know that elements 3, 7, and 11 are to be ignored.  My understanding is that the diagonal of the matrix (0, 5,10) represent the rotation about the X, Y, Z axis respectively.  What I don't understand is the purpose/meaning of the other matrix elements; 1,2,4,6,8,9.  My understanding is that those elements represent coupling between axis, but a body rotation should not have these.  Unless the matrix includes information about inertial, or the body is being distorted around axis?


This behaviour doesn't seem to make sense to me.


The code for the physics plugin is at: [https://abms.net.au/public/worldPhysicsC.c.zip](https://abms.net.au/public/worldPhysicsC.c.zip)


Q about the Physics in Webots.... I'm trying to simulate some noise in the motors/wheels in the epuck (differential robot).  I've tried a few ways so far and right now I'm attempting to alter the course of the epuck using `dBodySetAngularVel`.  I'm setting the y (yaw) parameter to some value that generates an effect.  Then, every 50 steps, I'm flipping the sign on the yaw parameter, which in theory should create a zig-zag path.  However this is not happening and I'm cannot understand why.  Attached is a video that demonstrates my point:  [https://abms.net.au/public/physics\_angular\_velocity\_oil\_slick\_then\_tar.mp4](https://abms.net.au/public/physics_angular_velocity_oil_slick_then_tar.mp4)

However, I would recommend you to use a 3D modeling software to create complex IndexedFaceSet nodes, such as Blender.


That's because faces are single sided. If you need double sided faces, you should define them twice, but with reverse vertex order in the second time.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 12:46:31
`@Francony` even if you have only one node in the children field this field type is still a MFNode so you should use   getMFNode.

getSFNode is reserved for SFNode (such as for example the ``phyiscs`` field of the ``Solid`` nodes).

##### Francony 04/17/2020 12:44:01
Hi, just out of curiousity, I have a children field with one node in it. When I used .getField("children").getSFNode() it didn't find it, but .getField("children").getMFNode(0) found it. Is there something i'm missing here?

##### nap 04/17/2020 09:53:22
In the physics plugin with an E-Puck robot, setting `dBodySetRotation(gRobotBodyID, body_posr.R);` rotates the body, but the wheels come off (that is they do not rotate with the body).  It would appear to me that this has something to do with how the `E-puck.proto` is defined.  Is that so?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 09:07:30
But unfortunately none for getting the inertia matrix. Nevertheless it shouldn't be very difficult to implement it. If you want to dig into the source code of Webots and implement it, you are very welcome!


There is an API function for getting the center of mass: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_center\_of\_mass](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_center_of_mass)

##### Francony 04/17/2020 09:05:46
okay, thats what I was wondering from my first question, I wasn't clear. Thanks a lot and have a nice day.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 09:04:51
Yes, if they are not present in the scene tree, you cannot retrieve them from a supervisor...

##### Francony 04/17/2020 09:03:31
Thanks for the quick answer. Thats what I thought but when I don't add them in manually and use "inertiaMatrix.getMFVec3f(0)" I get a "called with an out-of-bound index: 0" error, should I be accessing them differently?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/17/2020 09:00:51
Yes, if you don't specify the inertial matrices, they are automatically computed from the bounding object.

##### Francony 04/17/2020 08:59:35

If each robot has 4 cameras, this is probably the bottleneck. Cameras are expensive to simulate or the GPU, you should either try with a more powerful GPU either try reducing the camera refresh rates.

The Y axis pointing to the sky is a standard in VRML97 from which Webots inherited. I know RViz and other software more often use Z as the vertical axis. We are considering changing this into Webots, but that will take quite some time.

##### nap 04/15/2020 23:07:53
`@David Mansolino` : I did it.  It looks crap but it works.  I ended up using a Physics Plugin, but had to resort to dBodyGetRotation and dBodySetRotation because I couldn't get dBodyAddRelTorque and dBodyAddRelForce to work for some reason.


Anyone know much about Physics Plugins and the library functions available?


Why does the Y axis point up into the sky?  Should that not be the Z axis?

I'm using the (mistake) actually it's the `flying_mybot.c` example as a rough guide.


hmmm.  `@David Mansolino` :  I decided to use a Physics Plugin.

So I edited the E-puck PROTO and added a DEF leftHinge to the HingeJoint (same for the right side).

Set the physics node in WorldInfo to my plugin name.  In the plugin C file, I have defined a `dBodyID` for each joint in the init() method using `epuckHinges[0] = dWebotsGetBodyFromDEF("epuckLeftHinge");`.  And in the step() method, I have `dBodyAddForce(epuckHinges[0], 0.0, 0.0, 9.0);` for each hinge (-9.0 for the other one.); spin around the Z axis.

But my epuck still goes straight.


`@David Mansolino` :  It would be nice to be able to open two Webots windows. (Not to run in both, but to compare.)

> does Webots model super-balls?

`@nap` What so you mean by super-balls?


But maybe if you really want to introduce some 'randomness' in your simulation the simplest solution is to use a second controller using the Supervisor API which will perturbate the robot (by adding some random force/torque on the robot for example).

> I assume the simulation is based on rigid bodies, can I introduce something between the motor and the epuck body that varies the position/orientation of the wheel randomly?

`@nap` yes it is indeed, yes that's a possibility.


Webots API does not include any callback, but you might introduce some in the controller.

About the Brake, it will work if you control the motor in torque, if you use speed control, the PID controller will compensate for the brake (util it reaches the maximum torque).

About the battery, it will unfortunately switch on/or the motor but not influence the commands.

##### nap 04/15/2020 12:05:08
I assume the simulation is based on rigid bodies, can I introduce something between the motor and the epuck body that varies the position/orientation of the wheel randomly?


Is the power of the wheels affected by the battery state?  Can there be some noise introduced there?


`@David Mansolino` : I've looked at the E-puck.proto file, and whilst it is possible to add noise to the positional sensors, the follow-line behaviour does not use that information.  Instead it uses the GSM module to detect the line and simply sends differential motor commands.  I don't want to introduce more noise on the GSM as that will throw the control loop out.  RotationalMotors however does not allow a noise parameter.

Just thinking aloud here.  If I were to introduce a "Brake" device, with some friction coefficient, can noise be introduced there?

Are there any callbacks I could subscribe to in order to fiddle the motor commands?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 11:23:52
I guess you will have to tune the `ambientIntensity` parameter and `location` or  `direction` depending on the type of light you will select.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/light](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/light)


This is normal. To change the illumination of surrounding objects, you should setup lights in your environment.

> `@David Mansolino` : ok.  So it would be 'given to them' but in such a way that it would be 'obfuscated'?

`@nap` Yes exactly. Of course they can always manually edit the PROTO file a text editor, but this way more tricky.


For example for distance sensors, this is defined in the look-up table: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 08:46:12
For the sensors, this is defined directly in the Webots scene-tree (or can be hidden in a PROTO file if you want to hide this to your student).

##### nap 04/15/2020 08:45:07
`@David Mansolino` :  (1) I was thinking about this after I posted my question.  I suppose if the students work out how to disable the noise they can easily work out how to implement a feedback loop for this.

(2) Our students will be installing their own Webots versions based on the OS they have.  So I would need to supply them with our version of the sensor model.

 BTW, where would the sensor noise model be implemented?  Would it be in the controller as well or in a different part of the project (I have no idea atm.)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/15/2020 08:26:49
You may add artificial noise on the controller side, but this is indeed easy to disable for the students. 

Otherwise, you can rather add noise on the sensor side, most of the sensors in Webots do provide a noise model.

##### nap 04/15/2020 08:06:47
`@David Mansolino` : Thanks.  I'll take you up on that suggestion.  I was planning on making an introductory exercise for my students, but with no noise, I'll work out some other scenarios.

Is there a way of inducing noise?  (I don't want the students to simply disable it and then say "Look my project works".  lol

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/14/2020 11:33:06
Yes, you simply have to add a GPS node to your robot and write a controller that does the necessary motion to reach this point based on the current position returned by the GPS.

Hi `@Daniel Deng`, what you are doing looks correct (even so it is indeed always safer to save and revert to make sure the scene tree is completely up to date), can you please open an issue with this description here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

We will then try to fix the problem.

##### Daniel Deng 04/14/2020 05:58:15
Hi, I ran into a problem/bug, I have a solid with a group as its children, and the group as the bouldingobject. The group have contained two transforms, the first have a children shape DEF A, the second children use DEF A, (two identical shape, cylinder, at different place). When I change the radius of A, both cylinders change shape, which is correct. However, only one side of the boundingobject(white border) changed, resulting in different boundingobject on two sides. If I save and reload, the two sides will match again. I‚Äôm I missing something here?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/14/2020 05:49:39
> hiÔºåHow do I fix a robot (robotic arm) on the tableÔºüCan you help me ?

`@Jie` you simply have to make sure that the root node of the robot have a bounding object defined but no Physics node. Do you have one particular robot in mind?


> I want a synchronous controller in webots, for this I need a loop running, and only execute robot.step(timestep) when I give the command. How can I accomplish this. Is it possible inside webots, or do I HAVE to go the extern controller route?

`@Luftwaffel` this is indeed possible inside Webots, but you have to make sure that you have a callback (for example from a ROS service) that calls the ``robot.step(timestep)`` function.


> Hi, I want to make my own ROS controller. However, 'import rospy' doesnt work in a new controller, it only works when changing the existing universal\_robot\_ros controller. Any ideas as to why?

`@Luftwaffel` this is because this controller contains a ``runtime.ini`` files that adds the rospy libraries to the path, see: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/runtime.ini](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/runtime.ini)

> Hi, I'm using webots to test my robot with an uneven ground to prove the robustness.I find a floor object called unevenTerrain in webots, which can randomly generated uneven terrain based on Perlin noise.

`@Jeremy Jiang` the uneven terrain PROTO uses internally the ElevationGrid node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/elevationgrid)

Using this node you can create a floor with any custom eleveation (based on a regularly spaced grid).

How can I reset the whole KUKA yobot positions (both base and arm)? Thanks.

`@Zuxin` internal nodes of a PROTO node can't be manipulated, but you might reset the robot using the wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics function ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?version=develop#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics))

> hello, is there any sensor detect landmarks ?

`@kwy` 

If you want to evaluate your landmark detection algorithms (that can be scaled to the real-world) you can use ArUco Markers ([https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial\_aruco\_detection.html](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html)). OpenCV allows you to get position and rotation of the ArUco Markers, so you can use it to determine range and bearing. 



Otherwise, you can use Webots Recognition node. Just make sure to follow the instructions:

- [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/recognition)

- [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb\_camera\_has\_recognition](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=python#wb_camera_has_recognition)

##### nap 04/11/2020 08:08:41
So, the camera provides a frame to your controller and your controller scans the frame to see if there is a green spot.  if there is, then do action A, otherwise continue doing action B.


(That is how I program my controllers.)


You would probably do that in your "Controller".  Sensors are generally NOT smart;  they just provide the data.

##### kwy 04/11/2020 07:53:08
`@nap` It that possible to build a plugin which can recognise a  simple landmarks and provide bearing/range information. The landmarks can be very simple, like a green point on the wall.

##### nap 04/11/2020 07:21:37
`@Techcore` , good question.  One way to deal with the problem would be to record the value and compare the difference later?


`@kwy` Essentially, that would be a good approach if you're using some coordinate system.  Obviously you will/can check where the robot is and compare it to your map.

In order to get bearing/range information, your vision system will need to recognise things and provide that information.  Then you could use the 'triangulation' principle to see where you are, in which case you will usually fall back to a Cartesian coordinate system.

##### kwy 04/11/2020 02:41:46
`@nap` So can I divide the map into simple geometric areas, or convert map into matrix. And then find the location of the robot and landmarks on the map. Is this effective?



using vision can I get the information about the range and bearing?

##### nap 04/10/2020 16:03:39
If you're using vision, then you need some algorithm that is able to determine if it sees the landmark.


If you mean GPS or cartesian coordinates, then you need to know where you are and test whether you're at the landmark.


You need to configure your sensor analysis code to detect when a landmark is being sensed.


I would not think so, since a landmark can be anything.

Hi, is there a way to record motion files or an easy way to create them?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/09/2020 08:38:58
Yes, this is explained here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-limits](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-limits)

##### Laojiang 04/09/2020 08:36:10
In fact, it looks that the moving can break in the limits easily


My model can move now. However, I found that my both soft (minPosition and maxPosition) and hard limits (minStop and maxStop) don't do anything during  the model moving.


ok, I'll try it, thank you

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/09/2020 08:13:45
It depends on your model, if it is heavy, with high friction, it may be needed to increase it.

##### Laojiang 04/09/2020 08:12:46
The default value of RotationalMotor.maxTorque is 10 ,need I to increase it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/09/2020 08:10:32
Did you check the value of the `RotationalMotor.maxTorque` in your model? Maybe you should try to increase it?

##### Laojiang 04/09/2020 08:08:49
Can you help me to check my code?

In fact, I'm trying to control my model by torque. However, it doesn't move anything. And my code is very simple.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/09/2020 08:01:29
No, the PID values will be ignored in that case.

##### Laojiang 04/09/2020 07:58:38
when I use "wb\_motor\_set\_torque" to contorl my rotationalmotor, should I to change the "control PID" value as 0,0,0 ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/09/2020 07:13:56
`@nikzzzlegrande` what you want to achieve is called path planning, you will find some explanation and example with the e-puck robot and Webots here: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27\_Robot\_Curriculum/Advanced\_Programming\_Exercises#Path\_planning\_](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27_Robot_Curriculum/Advanced_Programming_Exercises#Path_planning_)[Advanced]

Hi, can you provide the pdf version of User guide and Reference Manual

##### JC 04/08/2020 20:57:09
ah ok thank you

##### Darko Lukiƒá [cyberbotics] 04/08/2020 20:51:08
`@JC` You need to call `robot.step(timestep)` periodically, e.g.:

```py
# Set motor velocity at e.g. 1 radian per second
motor.setVelocity(1)

# Let the motor move for a while
# The loop will create a pause of 10*timestep[ms]
for _ in range(10)
    robot.step(timestep)

# Do the other command...
```



You can find more about `.step()`  here:

##### JC 04/08/2020 20:10:36
Is there a way to stop execution of commands without stopping the whole simulation? My goal is to give my robot enough time to move its motors before going onto the next instruction. I have tried time.sleep but that just pauses the whole simulation and has no effect on the end result

perhaps. I reinstalled it for all users

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/08/2020 10:13:41
Instead of `C:\Users\...`? So, that would mean the problem arises when Webots is installed in the local user folder, but not when Webots is installed for all users (in `C:\Program Files\Webots`)?

##### Taechu„Öá„ÖÖ„Öá 04/08/2020 10:12:02

my route was the same as `@ƒ∞chigogo` 's  then I reinstalled Webots to c:\ program files

Which version of Python did you installed?

##### Taechu„Öá„ÖÖ„Öá 04/08/2020 10:10:46
earlier I only found one libjpeg-8.dll in my computer. the problem occurred after I installed python in the same route as Webots

##### ƒ∞chigogo 04/08/2020 10:10:02
its in the C:\Users\nur-b\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/08/2020 10:09:04
OK, so can you try to remove the one in the `windows.old` folder? By the way, where is folder located? Inside `C:\Program Files\Webots`?

##### ƒ∞chigogo 04/08/2020 10:06:22
I probably installed because its been a while .but It always like this from the first day I downloaded Webots. I searched  for libjpeg-8.dll I only have two one is in webots others again in webots but in windows.old folder .

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/08/2020 09:57:08
By the way, did you install any other software after installing Webots?

The name of the library is `libjpeg-8.dll`. It is located in `C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin` and Webots should use it. However, it seems your system as another version of this `libjpeg-8.dll` in a folder pointer to by your `PATH` environment variable and Webots uses it wrongly instead of using its own version. You should find this wrong library on your system and remove its path from your `PATH` environment variable or rename (temporarily) this conflicting library.

Hi `@thomas5mc` I guess you are trying to do the first step code tutorial from the documentation...

Here is a translated example of the c controller:

```python
from controller import Supervisor

# create a supervisor instance
supervisor = Supervisor()

# get the time step of the current world.
timestep = int(supervisor.getBasicTimeStep())

# retrieve concerned robot node from supervisor
robot_node = supervisor.getFromDef("MY_ROBOT")

# retrieve concerned field from robot node
translation_field = robot_node.getField("translation")

while supervisor.step(timestep) != -1:
    # retrieve and print values from translation field repeatedly
    res = translation_field.getSFVec3f()
    print("MY_ROBOT is at position:", res[0], res[1], res[2])

No, this is just for the root node, if the node has Solid nodes in tis children fields the total mass is the sum of all the individual masses.

##### Francony 04/07/2020 12:59:37

Hi `@Francony` each Solid node can have a Physics node and therfore its own mass, but Shape node are just visual, no physics

##### Francony 04/07/2020 12:54:56
Hi, I'm analyzing a robot on webots, but the overall mass of the robot is wrong. I see that there are masses under the Physics field of a node. My question is: is there another part where there could be masses? For example, I have a motor node with a Shape field that says "USE MOTOR" but there's no mass to be seen anywhere (tell me if what I wrote is too confusing). Thanks in advance.

`@Jie` if you use the 'New Controller' wizard, Webots will setup your project files for you so that you don't have to do anything else.


`@Luftwaffel`, you will have to implement inverse kinematic to do cartesian control with a robotic arm, we have one example distributed within Webots, this example use the an ABB robotic arm and the ikpy python library to do inverse kinematic: From what I understood you have to provide a web simulation. You are lucky webots does provide a web interface. If I where you I would create my simulation as a Webots simulation in a first step and then use the web interface of Webots to be able to share it throught a web page. As a first step I would start by playing with the mavic simulation in Webots that is probably the closest setup to what you are aiming for: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mavic-2-pro](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mavic-2-pro) Once you're happy with the simulation in Webots you may find interesting information about how to move it to the web here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse\_kinematics/inverse\_kinematics.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse_kinematics/inverse_kinematics.py)

`@ksardias` it seems you are using the Khepera 4 robot right? If yes, the distance sensors of the Khepera 4 are infra-red distance sensors, which means that they are influenced by the material of the object they are seeing. May I ask you to retry with a white box with a roughness of 0?

> And is there any sort of sensors for detecting colour, some sort of light sensor.

`@Shadow` why not using a camera? you can set it's resolution to 1x1.

Webots also provide a light sensor, but it is not very useful to detect color: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types)

Alternatively, you can use the distance-sensor of type ``infra-red`` which are impacted by the color of the object: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-types)

I.e. use red instead of infrared


`@Shadow` you can filter by colour, it doesn't offer an IR option but depending on your use case you could use some other colour instead of IR

But when I re-execute the controller again, the cameras don't get any data. In the visualisers in webots the cameras are working, but I just don't get the camera data, its None. I'm using python and executing the controller externally. I'm also disabling the cameras before finishing the controller loop.

You can use the wheel position sensors to get the total rotation of the wheel.

##### ksardias 04/02/2020 12:12:12
ok, but how can I control or count wheel rotation?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/02/2020 12:09:52
The radius of the wheel of the Khepera IV is 0.021meters

##### ksardias 04/02/2020 12:07:08
but if you give me better robot to this request I will be grateful


oh! first idea sounds greate form me, how to get wheel radius, i already use Khepera IV

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/02/2020 12:04:11
From the wheel radius you can compute how many radians you should rotate them, alternatively you can add a GPS device to your robot to get the absolute location.

##### ksardias 04/02/2020 12:03:09
`@David Mansolino` I can rotate the wheel, but I have a problem, how to measure distance

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/02/2020 12:01:22
Hi `@ksardias` yes you can! üòÑ 

It depends on which robot, but basically you have to rotate the wheel and stop then when you reached the target location

##### ksardias 04/02/2020 12:00:22

Hi, `@Laojiang` the first things to try to make sure it is not pycharm is to run your controller as a regular controller from the Webots IDE, this way you will be able at least to know if the problems comes from pycharm or not.

I have asked the other tutor to compile the controller from within the Webots Editor.  When I get a response, I will post the outcome here. (I'm running Webots on my Mac and am able to build without problems.)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 08:51:20
Webots controllers are not supposed to be compiled from a DOS console. I would recommend using Webots to compile them (or a MSYS2 terminal if you have installed the Webots development environment).

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 08:44:06
`@nap` do you get the same errors if you compile it from the Webots text editor?

##### nap 04/01/2020 08:38:32
When building my controller under windows, there were some errors reported.  These errors were not terminal, as the controller was produced and it ran fine in the Webots world I've developed for it.

Any one familiar with the cause of these errors?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 08:11:02
I am sorry, I just checked in the code, but changing the lock field while the simulation is running is not yet supported (it is supported only when the simulation is started), if you need this feature, please open an issue here and the development team will try to implement this as soon as possible: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=feature\_request.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

##### ClBaze 04/01/2020 08:06:37
Our connectors are not supposed to be magnetic, so I've set the autoLock to False. I've just increased the distance, axis and rotation tolerances but the problem persists. I figured out that if I run the simulation, save the scene and reload it the connector are well connected.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 07:17:07
Ok, in that case have you tried to swithc the 'autoLock' field? Make also sure that the distance, axis and rotation tolerance are big enough.

##### ClBaze 04/01/2020 07:14:35
`@David Mansolino` thank you, the thing is that my scene contains a lot of robots (>36) with each robot having 6 connectors. Attaching a controller to each connector will really slow down the simulation I think. So the idea was to have a unique controlleur using a supervisor to lock/unlock the connectors

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 06:38:34
You're welcome.

##### nap 04/01/2020 06:38:20
`@David Mansolino` , thank you!!  I'll see what we can do with that.

You will find some example using the e-puck here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#samples](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#samples)

In addition the Webots curriculum uses the e-puck too: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27\_Robot\_Curriculum](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27_Robot_Curriculum)

##### nap 04/01/2020 05:58:24
Ideally it would use more than the GSM module.


Sorry but this isn‚Äôt really a technical question.

With the Corvid situation, our ‚ÄòIntro to Robotics‚Äô course has gone online, and because it‚Äôs hard to get components, we‚Äôve decided to use Webots.

My question is: does anyone know if/where I might be able to download a working ePuck project that will work with the currently available Webots binaries?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 04/01/2020 05:27:46
`@ClBaze` why aren't you locking the connector from the connector controller directly? From the supervisor you can use the emitter to send a message when the connector need to lock and receive it from the controller of the connector with a receiver.

Hello, I'm using the supervisor getFromDef() function to get a pointer to a robot in the scene. It returns a node pointer. Is it possible to cast this pointer to a Robot pointer ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/31/2020 14:08:52
`@kwy` I checked your controller and the problem is that in Python the `send` function does accept strings only, you might change your controller like this to send the coordinate as a string:

```Python
from controller import Supervisor

TIME_STEP = 64

supervisor = Supervisor()
# /* get a handler to the emitter and to the robot /
emitter = supervisor.getEmitter("emitter")

# / get the field which contains the position of the robot*/
robot_node = supervisor.getFromDef("GPS_ROBOT")

robot_translation = robot_node.getField("translation")

while supervisor.step(TIME_STEP) != -1:
    robot_coords = robot_translation.getSFVec3f()
    emitter.send("%lf %lf %lf" % (robot_coords[0], robot_coords[1], robot_coords[2]))
```

Or use the Python `struct` module as explained in the Pyton part of the emitter.send function documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab-language=python#emitter-functions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab-language=python#emitter-functions)

`@Dorteel` You should set the ``borderRadius``to a smaller value (e.g. 0.002).

About the different pictures, I am not so sure. You probably have to create your own model for this.

but i also need "robot.step(8000) "

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/31/2020 11:57:37
The supervisor class inherits from the robot class, so you should only call:

```
supervisor = Supervisor()
```

And remove the:

```
robot = Robot()
```

You can then use the `supervisor` instance as if it was a `robot` instance

Do you think the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X is a good choice instead? It has 12 cores and is 300$ cheaper than your recommendation

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/30/2020 11:21:44
Also, if robot controllers are supposed to run on the same machine, I would prefer a machine with at least 12 virtual cores (which is anyhow the case for the CPUs I just recommended).


Depending on your budget, a slightly more modest configuration may also do the job if your simulation is not too intensive (like not using a high frame rate for high resolution camera images, low physics time step, etc.).


Hi, I would recommend a Intel i9-10980XE or AMD Ryzen 9 3950X CPU and a NVIDIA RTX 2080 (or RTX 2070 or GTX 1080 Ti).

`@CadenGS`, which version of Windows are you using? Can you trying launching the installer as administrator?


Even so we usually prefeer this way:

```Python
 rgb = (r << 16) + (g << 8) + b
```


Hi `@[]`, you're solution is pefectly correct indeed.

##### [] 03/28/2020 18:42:58
We input the int value and seems to work, while if we convert it to hex(int\_rgb) it gives error.


int\_rgb = rgb\_to\_rgbint((255, 0, 0))

print("HEX VALUE===")

print(int\_rgb)



led\_z\_pos.set(int\_rgb)


def rgb\_to\_rgbint(rgb):

    r = rgb[0]

    g = rgb[1]

    b = rgb[2]

    rgb = 65536 * r + 256 * g + b

    #value = hex(rgb)

    #value = '0x%02x%02x%02x' % rgb

    return rgb


Ok I think I gt the answer:


Hi,

I'm trying to set with PYTHON Webots API the color of led based on the camera readings RGB colors. But I cant manage to find any conversion tool in Webots API that allos to convert RGB readings form



image\_array = camera\_object.getImageArray();

image\_array = [[[116, 55, 35]], [[117, 57, 37]], [[115, 57, 39]]]



Into the HEX format that LED requires ( R8G8B8 ).



Any idea on how this could be accomplished?

Isnt there a :



led\_camera.set(value=[[116, 55, 35])?

You're welcome

##### Luftwaffel 03/26/2020 14:55:07
Thank you, I will have a look. So many rabbit holes üòÑ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 14:53:22
We have an interface with ROS and therefore MoveIt is available through ROS, however this part is only available for the Universal Robots. But it should be quite simple to extend it to other robotic arms, here is the description: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots)

The code of the controller providing the ROS interface is available here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros)

Alternatively, we are currently creating a more powerfull and generic interface with ROS2: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2)

But MoveIt support for ROS2 is still not perfect.

> For example: 

> Lets say we execute in the webots controller a motors.setPosition(pos) for every timestep, with each position being a waypoint of the trajectory. Would this work? Or would we run into problems with the internal PID controller. To my understanding, it tries to reach that position and then stop, while we want to keep going, after it reaches that position

`@Luftwaffel` this should work, if you make sure to set the position at each step it should work, and even better, if I am not wrong moveit can generate velocity in addition of position, so you can also specify the velocity at each step in Webots in addition of the position.

##### Luftwaffel 03/26/2020 14:47:46
For example: 

Lets say we execute in the webots controller a motors.setPosition(pos) for every timestep, with each position being a waypoint of the trajectory. Would this work? Or would we run into problems with the internal PID controller. To my understanding, it tries to reach that position and then stop, while we want to keep going, after it reaches that position


Or if not, if we create a trajectory using moveit for example (a list of joint positions), how would we go about executing these in Webots?


Have you interfaced with moveit?


I already implemented IKFast. The issue is not IK itself, but motion planning (trajectories). Meaning not just getting a valid solution vor position B, but the 'how to get from A to B'

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 14:10:23
Webots doesn't provide such tool out of the box, but it is very easy to use external libraries executing inverse kinematics, here is an example with the same robot arm that is using the ``ikpy``python  module (this module is used internally by MoveIt too): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse\_kinematics/inverse\_kinematics.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/abb/irb/controllers/inverse_kinematics/inverse_kinematics.py)



And here is an example of the result:



[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4)

##### Luftwaffel 03/26/2020 14:05:43
Is there already some sort of implementation for trajectories? Currently I calculate the end position with Inverse Kinematics, however, the PID controller just changes the angles of the motors in proportion to the start and goal angle. This can cause the end effector to crash into the ground, if the new position is a larger positional change. Any Ideas on how to approach this? For example with ROS, Moveit and Gazebo, there is trajectory controllers. Is there anything similar in Webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 13:33:33
I mean you can remove the parent 'Robot' node and put instead directly the rb4600-40 node.

##### Luftwaffel 03/26/2020 13:32:53
root node?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 13:32:30
You're welcome.

With the fixed/updated version not anymore, you will just have to set it as root node and set the 'staticBasis' field to ``TRUE``.

##### Luftwaffel 03/26/2020 13:31:05
Is there a reason then, to have the robotic arm proto inside of a generic robot node?


thank you üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 12:48:46
HI `@Luftwaffel`, in the development version of Webots we added a few weeks ago a new field allowing you to attach the robot to the environment:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1349](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1349)

To use this patch you can either copy the patch to your local version of the PROTO or use on of the nightly builds of Webtos including the patch: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)



Another workaround would be to define a 'boundingObject' for your parent PROTO without physics object.

##### Luftwaffel 03/26/2020 12:26:33
I may have missed something, but I couldnt find the answer in the documentation: How can I fix the base of the robot? I have a robot node with the irb4600-40 proto node in children. As it is a robotic arm, I want to have the base fixed in the world. currently it is wiggling around a bit (as can be seen from the translation and rotation of the children node)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/26/2020 10:21:53
Reseting the physics just means that the velocity of all the Solids will be set to 0, but this will not reset the position. You probably better reset the simulation if you want the robot to be placed at it's initial position, please see:  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb\_supervisor\_world\_reload-function](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods#using-the-wb_supervisor_world_reload-function)

By the way I am adding a warnings in the Webots code that will warn you in the future versions of Webtos if you use this function while the 'supervisor' field is not set to ``TRUE``: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1501](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1501)

I have run into a very peculiar issue. For some reason the time required for this timestep increases with each reset. This adds up quickly. In the simulation this manifests itself by requiring many minutes up to hours of simulation time, even though it should only be milliseconds (128 to be exact). Running at real-time-speed, resets would take literally 30min-2h after a little bit

And then you can call `self.simulationResetPhysics(robot)`.

Hi `@Laojiang` do you want to reset the whole world or only one specific robot?

how can I reset my model by code?

This point is the origin of the robot. It is where the handles are located when you select the robot.

You're welcome üôÇ

##### osiixy 03/25/2020 12:44:18
`@David Mansolino`  thank you!ü§©  It worked (I just copypaste it for testing and changed \ to / cause of Linux)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/25/2020 12:39:12
Hi `@osiixy`, we fixed an issue with makefiles adding a spaces in the file a few weeks ago in the development version of Webots: 

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1304](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1304)

This is not yet released, but you can already get a patched version using the nightly builds to check if this fixes your issue:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

Alternatively, you may also try to simply apply the patch to you local Makefile of your controller.

##### osiixy 03/25/2020 12:36:12
hi! I use Manjaro and Webots is unable to build controller. During the make process an extra space is added after the WEBOTS\_HOME path (/opt/webots /resources   so after webots in my case), however my path does not contain that extra space (I've checked  and redefined it many time). It seems that it happens in the Makefile, but I cannot figure it out why.

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:09:40
oh alright!! i will check the write rights!! thanks for the answers!! üôÇ

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 14:08:46
Note: the resulting file will be located in your controller directory, so you must have write rights there so that the file will be created.

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:08:19
it looks exactly like this!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 14:07:46
If your code look like this [https://www.javatpoint.com/fprintf-fscanf-in-c](https://www.javatpoint.com/fprintf-fscanf-in-c), then it should work in a Webots controller as well.

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:07:19
yup!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 14:06:52
Are you doing this in the main control loop?

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:05:58
just creates a file but writes nothing in it!


tried fprintf, it didnt work in webots

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 14:05:32
It's a standard C programming question, not related with Webots.

##### divya 03/24/2020 14:05:11

In blender?

How did you defined the path, absolute or relative ?


Yes unfortunately, the exporter is not compatible with Blender 2.8 yet.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 08:56:25
Are you using the blender to Webots exporter or exporting from Blender to VRML ?

##### Tosidis 03/24/2020 08:55:45
Is it possible to set a correct path for them so it loads them automatically? ( i need more than enough models to run some experiments and it really takes quite some time to change the url manually)


I am importing some models from Blender, but the texture url is not correct , which results in me needing to change the appearance colormap url in every model manually.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 08:53:49
Of course

##### Tosidis 03/24/2020 08:53:40
And since i have another 'problem' maybe you could help me with that aswell

it was suggested from omichel here : I could reproduce the problem as well, but I noticed that it can be fixed by starting webots.bat instead of webots.exe. This is probably due to the fact the DOS cmd.exe ignores the webots.exe.config file that adds an extra path to the search for shared libraries (e.g., ../../usr/bin).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 08:52:14
Perfect, very good news.

##### Tosidis 03/24/2020 08:51:59
running it through webots.bat (instead of webots.exe, and with administrative rights (don't know if it is needed though)) solves the problem

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/24/2020 08:51:30
Can you please try from the command line, following the instructions here:

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#windows](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#windows)

Hi! Either you set the WorldInfo.gravity to 0 0 0, or you actively reset the position of every object to its initial value at every step (from the supervisor). Or you remove the Physics node from your objects so that they won't be subject to gravity and other dynamics behaviors.

##### Francony 03/23/2020 17:26:40

`@tilly`, how did you install Webots?

Please make sure that the Webots application is in your `PATH` environment variable. Can you please show us the ouput of the `env` command?


`@PTosidis`, yes probably, there is nothing platform specific in this plugins.


`@dpimbi`, about the sensors, you might use DistanceSensors (whith infra-red type): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#infra-red-sensors](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#infra-red-sensors)

Or a camera: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera)

For both option you can find example in Webots.

For DistanceSensors: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck\_line\_demo-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/epuck#e-puck_line_demo-wbt)

Ok but this does not change the outcome

##### Hue [cyberbotics] 03/21/2020 15:00:07
you can :

`export WEBOTS_HOME=/path/to/webots`

Also you can append this command to the end of of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc so the shell will remember it.


You have to set the environment variable WEBOTS\_HOME where your installation folder is at.

OK, good. About the wheel of the kuka, they actually are not so complex, in Webots we use asymetrical friction as an optimization to simulate omnidirectional wheel, this way the physical complexity of the model is very low.

##### User21 03/19/2020 16:31:02
okay i lowered the frequency of the lida sensory and now its working better. But generally the wheels of the kuka are very complex arent they?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 16:22:44
The first things is to identify where is the bottlneck, physics complexity of the robot or the GPU measure of the lidar.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:54:32
yes, but usually a robot translation field is a SFVec3f field and not a MFVec3f.

##### tilly 03/19/2020 14:52:20
assuming root\_children\_field is where i added the robots and 11 is the number of the node of the robot in the tree


something like this


value = 0.5

        root\_children\_field.getMFNode(11).getField("translation").setMFVec3f(0, value)

        root\_children\_field.getMFNode(11).getField("translation").setMFVec3f(1, value)

        root\_children\_field.getMFNode(11).getField("translation").setMFVec3f(2, value)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:43:32
but if all your robots have the same DEF name you can also retrieve them by the position in the parent "children" field: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_node](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_get_mf_node)

eg i have 3 thymio2 nodes


How can i access certain nodes

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:38:36
you have to retrieve the newly inserted robot using the Supervisor API, then its translation field and using the `setSFVec3f` function you can move it to a new position  [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f)

after initializing the robots where do i can set the position?


got it thanks

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 14:30:22
you should put the 'children' field of the root object

##### tilly 03/19/2020 14:29:01
Field.importMFNode(FIELD? ,position = -1, filename = "path/to/my/wbofile/Thymio2.wbo") what should i insert by FIELD?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/19/2020 13:57:17
You will find a very simple example in C for importing a Robot in the root children field.


UNfortunately not, but you can import any node using these functions in particular: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node\_from\_string](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node_from_string)

`@David Mansolino` I tested with that version and the error is still there...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/18/2020 08:57:51
The first things to check is wheter you can connect to the robot using the e-puck default tool to the robot, such as this one: [https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/E-Puck#PC\_interface](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/E-Puck#PC_interface)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/18/2020 08:22:39
This is probably because you are missing a `Makefile.e-puck` file in your controller folder. See for example:

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/18/2020 08:12:42
Yes, it is recommended to save it in the `protos` folder of your current webots project.

##### seenu 03/18/2020 08:09:22

About the position and orientation, you may also be interested by the supervisor API to get position and orientation of any node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

Another thing: creating a new project with the wizard and adding a rectangle arena, the 'up' coordinate is 'y' instead of 'z'. Is there a reason for this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 16:16:18
The usual way is to use position sensors: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor)

Using these sensors you can get the angle/position of the joint

##### Luftwaffel 03/17/2020 16:15:16
that or in relation to the base joint. But in general I would like to have access to my joints. Adding GPS sensors in order to read position seems weird. And it doesnt provide orientation

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 16:13:30
GPS should return you the global X-Y-Z position, is this what you want ?

##### Luftwaffel 03/17/2020 16:12:18
I will try the debug version tomorrow. In the meantime a noob question: How can I get the position and orientation of my robot's joints? I have tried for an hour, reading the documentation etc. but I can't seem to figure it out. I added a GPS node to the tool slot of my robotic arm, but that just has the position in relation to its own coordinate system, which is useless.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 16:00:02

Hi, is there an example for using ros service with webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:47:15
you can use one of these:

  - webots\_2020a-rev2\_amd64\_debug.deb

  - webots-R2020a-rev2-x86-64\_debug.tar.bz2


`@Luftwaffel` I just finished to upload debug version of Webots in this nightly build: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly\_16\_3\_2020](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly_16_3_2020)

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:33:02
But it is almost never needed.


But you can add custom cleanup in the  `__del__` method of the object in Python.


No, it's not needed. It's done automatically when the object is destroyed.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:28:56
thanks, do i need the clean up method in python?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:26:22
And your `Robot` node (in the Webots world file) should have the `supervisor` field set to `TRUE`.


Because your `robot` variable should be an instance of a `Supervisor`, not a `Robot`

%end


ok thanks

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:23:21
Yes, this is because it's a non-static member method, therefore, you shouldn't call it with the `Supervisor.` prefix, but with your robot instance as a prefix, e.g., `robot.simulationQuit(0)`

Or do you get a runtime error?


What do you mean with "doesnt work"? It doesn't quit Webots?

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:17:44
when i call Supervisor.simulationQuit(status) in python what should status be EXIT\_SUCCESS, "EXIT\_SUCCESS", 0, 1 doesnt work

You are welcome.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:01:50
Thanks again

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:01:22
Yes, simply have a supervisor that will call `wb_supervisor_simulation_quit()` after the fixed time you want.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 14:00:42
Much Thanks. Is there a way to let one run be a fixed time

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 14:00:19
And possibly `--minimize` and `--stdout` and `--stderr`.


For launching series of runs, I would recommend you to start Webots with the `--batch` option, see [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots)


Then, you should create a single floor with a texture that matches your need. Such a superposition of floor will likely give you strange results...

##### tilly 03/17/2020 13:58:27
yes they are superposed (lay like 0.0001 over the first floor)


for the ground sensors


for different floor colors

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 13:57:24
Why do you need 4 floors? Are they superposed?


See hints here to improve your physics simulation to get rid of these warnings: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/modeling)

##### tilly 03/17/2020 13:56:16

i have the basic arena + some thymios + 4 floors i need for different ground conditions

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/17/2020 13:54:21
These warnings are caused by the complexity of your simulation model. You may fix them by decreasing the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep or by simplifying your model.

##### tilly 03/17/2020 13:53:00
(for a scale)


500 to 1000 runs


and the next question is it possible to do like multiple independent runs without graphic interface with mac


??


is it possible to surpress these warnings

If you want that the message is sent to any Receiver device you can set the Emitter channel to `-1` (see the channel field description in Emitter documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter))


`@nelsondmmg` the Emitter message is sent to a specific channel and all the Receiver devices listening on the same channel will receive it. So you don't have to specify any address.

##### nelsondmmg 03/17/2020 09:56:40
Hi, I'm reading the Emitter API documentation and I did not found how to specify the address of the message. I would like to send it to receiver in another node (in this case emulation a vehicle 2 vehicle communication). There is this phrase: **The wb\_emitter\_send function adds to the emitter's queue a packet of size bytes located at the address indicated by dataThe wb\_emitter\_send function adds to the emitter's queue a packet of size bytes located at the address indicated by data**, but I don't know how to create the packet adding the message + address.

unfortunately there is no sample simulation using AI or similar in Python. The `advanced_genetic_algorithm` simulation (you can search for it in `File > Open Sample World...`)  uses a C supervisor controller but it could help you structuring your Python controller.

##### Luftwaffel 03/16/2020 16:45:29
Thank you, the supervisor thing worked :). Can you recommend a good starting point for the OpenAI implementation? Doesnt have to be perfect or 100% working. Some python controller examples would already help a lot.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 16:32:30
About OpenAI gym there is currently no official implementation for Webots. But it is possible to write a custom interface for it.

We know that some users are implementing an interface for OpenAI but it is not public yet


`@Luftwaffel` Supervisor class inherits from Robot class, so you can simply write

`robot = Supervisor()`

##### Luftwaffel 03/16/2020 16:26:02

Hi, is there a implementation of OpenAI gym with webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 15:13:04
You're welcome

##### JC 03/16/2020 15:12:59
oh i see, thank you for the help!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 15:12:27
You first have to get the node itself, e.g.:

```Python
node = supervisor.getSelf()
position = node.getPosition()
```

##### JC 03/16/2020 15:07:04
im in python and i cant seem to get supervisor.getPosition() to work, im not sure what im missing but i feel like its something

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 15:05:10
Yes, you can either use a GPS either use the Supervisor API.

##### JC 03/16/2020 15:04:42
Is there any way to get the translation of a robot through the controller?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 11:43:42
Yes, this is on our roadmap, we plan to create a platform for the community to share their models. However, in the meantime, we highly encourage users to create a pull-request to include their model directly in the main repository: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots)

If you create a model of the kinova JACO2 robotic arm we will be more than happy to assist you for integrating it in Webots.

##### Luftwaffel 03/16/2020 11:38:56
Have you considered an unofficial supported robot list, where users can submit their files? So not multiple people have to do the same work over and over again. For example, If I were to make the kinova JACO2 robotic arm run in Webots, it would be helpful for others, to easily be able to find it and use it as a starting point for their work.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 10:46:04
But we have the universal robot arms: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/ure)


It is indeed a good candidate, unforunately we only have limited time and much to do, so its not on our short term plan.

##### Luftwaffel 03/16/2020 10:44:54
Do you have current plans of adding Kinova robotic arms? It is very popular in research and teaching. Adding the JACO2 and JACO3 arms would make webots a good alternative to Gazbeo and ROS


thank you for the infos üôÇ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 10:41:10
You might also use the URDF to Webots to import new model: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)


They indeed both use ODE, howver, Webots uses a customized version of ODE with multi-thread support.

About the models, it is true that Webots use more optmized model (both on the rendering and physical side).

About the robot models, here is a list of available model by default in Webots (but you might find some other maintained by the community on internet): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots)

##### Luftwaffel 03/16/2020 10:35:04
So the main difference in performance between Webots and Gazebo (since both use ODE) stems from the model refinement you guys do? Like replacing meshes with simple geometry like cylinders and spheres where applicable? Also, is there a list of already implemented and future implemented robots. For example KUKA or Kinova robotic arms would be very interesting.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 09:24:49
It is indeed only for rendering, for physics, you might use the multi-CPU feature of Webots (disable by default): see 'optimalThreadCount' field documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo#worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo#worldinfo)

##### Luftwaffel 03/16/2020 08:37:21
`@David Mansolino` Hi, thx for the reply. Does Webots use GPU for physics calculation, or just for rendering? I tried Webots a little 6 month ago and it definitely looks better visually, but my main concern is the physics simulation speed.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/16/2020 06:48:04
Hi `@Luftwaffel`, generally speaking Webots is faster than Gazebo, this is mainly due to its native intensive usage of the GPU. Many simulations run at a speed way higher than 1-2x real time. But the best is to make yourself your own idea by trying it, when you install Webots you get plenty of sample simulations that will allow you to quickly check the simulation speed of Webots on your computer.

##### Luftwaffel 03/15/2020 19:08:25
Hi, I have a general question about Webots, compared to Gazebo or other simulators. I'm looking for the best Simulator to use for training Reinforcement learning algorithms. One major deciding factor is the simulation speed. With gazebo, it is hard for me to get over 1-2x real time factor. It simply doesnt scale with more cores, or uses any GPU acceleration for physics calculations. Can anyone give me some info, how Webots performs and scales?

##### User21 03/13/2020 15:59:09
Ah okay, thanks so much!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 15:57:22
You can use the 'controllerArgs' field to define the position, this controllerArgs fields defines the arguments with which the controller is started

##### User21 03/13/2020 15:43:49
Can a controller have more then one executeable Scripts? I want to use multiple Pioneers which all have the same controll functions like Drive form Point A to Point B. But the should go to diffren positions so i dont want to make a folder for each robot  which contains the same besides the one execute script.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 15:43:21
You're welcome

##### User21 03/13/2020 15:33:07
okay i will try thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 15:32:23
Yes of course, you can get the root node of the world using the wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_root ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_root](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_root)) function. This root node is a hidden 'Group' node, you can therefore get its 'children' field and parse all the nodes inside.

##### User21 03/13/2020 15:31:40
*manually


My goal is to set the name from the robot in code and call the set name without naming them manual


Okay, if i have two robots and i want to get the translation from the second one at the first one i can call the node by using getFromDef.

Is ther another posibility to get the node?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 15:26:49
Hi `@User21`, not, unfortunately it is not possible to modify it using the supervisor API

##### User21 03/13/2020 15:25:13
Hi, is it possible to define the DEF from Code?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 12:43:29
Yes, you have to set the boundign objects and physics fields

##### Deep 03/13/2020 12:42:06
`@David Mansolino` If I get this straight, when importing a 3D object I have to set its collision detection parameters which are required for any physical force to be applicable on it?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 11:04:25
Alternatively you can "un-prototize" you node by re-clicking on the node in the scene-tree and selecting 'Convert to Base Node(s)'.


Yes you should be able to add it directly here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/protos/Nao.proto#L797](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/protos/Nao.proto#L797)

##### LaCava 03/13/2020 11:03:08
^ that worked, it seems!


Ahh yup, found it in the full-fat NAO PROTO ‚Äî can I just manually add the recognition node of the field isn‚Äôt listed?


Yup - it‚Äôs the NAO. May just be misunderstand how to do this, sorry about that. I appreciate the help.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 10:54:25
Ok, in that case the camera is probably defined in the PROTO, are you using a PROTO distributed within Webots?

##### LaCava 03/13/2020 10:51:30
Not sure: the PROTO itself has fields like the camera width and height. I have to access it in the controller through the getCamera functions, but there are no fields corresponding to it anywhere else.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/13/2020 10:49:23
Hi `@LaCava`, so where is the camera defined? In the open fields of the PROTO?

##### LaCava 03/13/2020 10:48:33
Is there any way to add a recognition node to a robot that doesn‚Äôt have it by default? I tried adding to to the PROTO in the world file, but the camera itself isn‚Äôt actually specified in the PROTO so it won‚Äôt recognize it.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 16:34:10
It is not possible out of the box to ignore gravity for one specific object, but you might add a force opposed to the gravity to cancel it using the `wb_supervisor_node_add_force` function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_add_force)


You're welcome

##### Deep 03/12/2020 15:23:19
(If I may ask)


`@David Mansolino` Thanks david! And how can I make it ignore gravity but still respond to other forces?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 15:15:18
Hi `@Deep`, no such human face are available out of the box in Webots. However you can create your own model by importing any human face model you can find on internet in VRML format using in IndexedFaceSet (see for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#high\_resolution\_indexedfaceset-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#high_resolution_indexedfaceset-wbt))

##### Deep 03/12/2020 15:09:42
Dear person who is reading this:

Hey, I want to add a flying human face with approximately realistic properties and texture. Is there a model such as this for me to download?

I noticed the human being in the software doesn't have face.



I just need a static flying face.

Thanks a bunch.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:55:39
You're welcome

##### coderrr 03/12/2020 14:45:30
Thank you so much `@David Mansolino` üëç

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:31:24
You can, but you can also probably find some libraries that can handle such transformations out of the box.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:30:37
Would you recommend usingwebots.maths for this kind of operations (even if the API isn't public) ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:28:15
That's indeed the only solution.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:26:57
I want to get velocity of a Solid given it's own frame, is the only solution to use  `wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation`, transpose it, and multiply the global velocity vector with it (ugh, not easy) ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:25:46
Yes that's it, it is global velocity.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:24:58
(My experiments shows me that get\_velocity seems to be also in the global frame)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 14:24:37
Hi `@Axel M`, let me check.

##### Axel M 03/12/2020 14:22:48
The doc specifies that `wb_supervisor_node_get_position` is relative to the global (world) frame


Hi, in which frame does `wb_supervisor_node_get_velocity` express it's velocities ? In world frame or local node frame ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 10:29:38
`@nelsondmmg` you cannot control directly a device from another robot controller.

But instead you can let the two robot controllers communicate (for example using the Emitter/Receiver nodes). You should modify the pedestrian controller so that it processes your request to get the velocity and sends it back to your controller.


`@yash` for a simple example you can look at the Camera device sample simulation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#camera-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#camera-wbt)

The method you use depends on what you want to achieve. You can use common image processing based on the Camera image.

##### nelsondmmg 03/12/2020 10:21:47
How can I reach a GPS node and use getSpeed from another controller? I'm trying to read the velocity of a pedestrian, which uses the controller implemented in the pedestrian.wbt (it is translated, it does not move). Thanks!

##### yash 03/12/2020 09:39:12
I want to detect a red solid object using camera ....Can anyone please help regarding it? Do we have to use the recognition functions for this purpose ?

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:57:37
Oh my god! Thank you very very much!!! I can do it now!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:55:28
The time will increase only when you start the controller and the controller calls the 'step' function.

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:54:39
yes, you are right. After I revert the simulation, the warning is gone. However, the time still doesn't increase. And robots doesn't move, too.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:49:40
Unfortunately sicne webots is not yet able to detect crash/unexpected exit of the controller yet, the workaround is to manually revert the simulation before you start the controller from PyCharm.

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:44:36
So what can I do to solve it?


yes yes , I agree with you!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:41:37
It seems that somehow you controller exists sometime before the first step in a unusual way and therefore Webots is not aware that the controller exited. This is why it is not able to 'release' the controller and therefore displays this warning.

Woudl this make sense in your case ?

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:40:03
Excuse me for my english grammar mistakes


I just restart webots and pycharm and when the time increasing first time. However, after the first start, the time doesn't change again. finally, after some trying , the warning here again.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:27:22
Can you try to revert the simulation and then start the controller again from PyCharm ?

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:26:27
It can work normally just when I use webots itself.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:24:19
Ok, but from the screenshot it seems it worked for the first time but not for the next ones, can you confirm?

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:23:49
Is there no place for me to configure it?

no, just one instance

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:20:22
ok, do you have more than one instance of Webots open at the same time?

##### Laojiang 03/12/2020 08:19:53
No, the time doesn't change.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 08:17:28
If you start the simulation, is the time increasing?


This Warning message seems to indicate that none of your robot controllers are using the 'extern' controller.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/12/2020 07:01:27
`@taeyoung`, in that case you should probably ignore the warning.


`@coderrr`, one simple solution is to check the bounding object of the robot in its PROTO, for example for the e-puck robot the radius of the cylinder is 0.037 meters: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L1138](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L1138)

[https://linuxhint.com/uninstall-debian-packages/](https://linuxhint.com/uninstall-debian-packages/)


for example running

```apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get -f install
dpkg --configure -a

but usually you first have to fix the broken package before being able to uninstall it


is it the same with  `dpkg --remove webots`?

##### taeyoung 03/11/2020 10:16:32

Ubuntu 16.04, and  using debian

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/11/2020 10:13:30

Hi, I have problem with using pycharm for webot controller these days, if some can give me help, it would be appreciated.

##### Deep 03/09/2020 11:12:15
Thanks olivers

See [https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim/blob/master/worlds/naoqisim.wbt#L44](https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim/blob/master/worlds/naoqisim.wbt#L44)


`@Deep`: Webots simulation are 100% reproducible if the controller programs are synchronous and deterministic. In case of use with naoqi, the non-reproducibility comes likely from naoqi and also from the fact that the naoqisim controller may be asynchronous (if Nao.synchonization = FALSE). See explanation here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#field-summary)

##### User21 03/09/2020 11:02:39
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` okay thank you

##### Deep 03/09/2020 11:02:15
`@Olivier Michel` I understand that, I just wondered if there are similar things such as that with other robots.



Anyway. I'd like to ask something else.

It seems like the simulation is not 100% the same every run.

There are different mechanical error each run. Is that intended?

Is running under "real time" mode would make it more consistent?

Any other tip?

Thanks

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 11:00:49
Hi`@User21`, the controller programs are independent. You can use the Emitter/Receiver nodes to communicate between the Ur5e controller and the Pioneer controller.

##### User21 03/09/2020 10:58:42
Hi there,

im having 2 Robots. One Ur5e and a Pioneer 3Dx. The Pioneer should move to the Ur5e and wait till the Ur5e grabs an object and place it on the Pioneer. Can i access my Ur5e Controller from my Pioneer Controller to get Feedback if my Ur5e reached his goal?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 10:54:51
`@jinu061353`: check webots/projects/samples/devices/controllers/motor/motor.c for example.

##### Gautier A. 03/09/2020 10:50:37
`@Olivier Michel` Understood, thank you a lot !

Also, collision detection can be disabled from within the same robot by setting Robot.selfCollision to FALSE.


`@Gautier A.`: there no collision detection for consecutive joints.

Is there an example of motor control using torque?

##### yash 03/09/2020 10:12:47
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`  thanks for the information

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 10:07:13
`@yash` yes, each Solid node in your model represents a real part of your robot, so it has a mass or density and specific physics properties that you should specify to build a realisitc model. Here is the documentation of the Physics nodes: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics#how-to-use-physics-nodes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics#how-to-use-physics-nodes). 

If you don't need to specify the physics properties of a Solid node, then it could be that you don't need to use a Solid node, but maybe it could be replaced by a Group or Transform node.

##### yash 03/09/2020 10:00:54
as you can see the physics mode enabled under the main robot node ....so should I just specify the parameters in that or also to the physics node under solid nodes present in its children

just provide the parameters to the main robot node


My robot consists of different solid nodes.......therefore after enabling the physics mode should have to provide the parameters such as mass,density etc of all the solid nodes or

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 08:57:48
`@soheil` good to know! I will check the unit vector issue and improve the documentation if needed.

Maybe you could try to reset the whole simulation after many robot moves ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_reset\_physics](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_simulation_reset_physics)).

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 07:48:45
`@Deep`: your question seems to be specific to naoqi and not to Webots. I am sorry I won't be able to help you. You should maybe ask to naoqi experts instead, maybe SoftBank robotics support?

##### soheil 03/09/2020 07:21:11
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Firstly Thanks for your answer. I found out that was because the vector (x, y, z) was not unit length. That should not be forgotten. And I do reset the node physics. But this problem will happen in a long run(for example 1000 times of changing the rotation)  despite it is really less than the last case. How do you think I can handle it?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 03/09/2020 07:09:16
`@Soheil` how do you change the rotation of the robot? Usually when changing the position or rotation of a robot from the controller program it is recommended to reset the physics to avoid this kind of issues (see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics))


`@Shadow` could you please write a bug report in GitHub and provide a sample world where you can reproduce this crash? [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new/choose) I checked a couple of worlds on Linux with the latest Webots version but everything works fine for me

##### Shadow 03/08/2020 20:38:25
When ever I open the velocity tab in the hierarchy window of a solid node with no physics node (NULL), webots crashes.

##### Soheil 03/08/2020 15:09:40
I have a humanoid robot which is something like a modified version of robotis op3. When I change its rotation, the robot surprisingly happens to face ridiculous problems. For example, its joints start to take apart or merge into each other. Does anyone has any idea about this?

##### Deep 03/08/2020 13:45:12
Hey guys. I compiled a control for nao with naoqi enabled thanks to the help of one of the people here, and it connects to the required software as it should.



I am now facing a small need. I am trying to a send a tiny object recognition database to the virtual robot(Through naoqi). It seems that when I try to do so I'm getting an error that perhaps there is no memory left on the robot. And the connection with the robot is closed. I was wondering if anyone may have a tip as to how I could solve this issue.

i will check it out, thank you

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:44:06
You can download it from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)


I believe you should use the latest nightly build of Webots as we recently fixed a bug affecting some ROS versions. See [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1426](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1426) for details.

##### Lussfer 03/06/2020 16:42:19
got "Python 2.7.17" as a result

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:40:10
From the same Terminal in which you started Webots, can you type "python -V -V" to check it?

ahhh okay great thank you very much.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:13:11
You should be able to see this from the robot window if you double-click on the Tiago robot in Webots and then display the position sensors.


And you will see that a motor is named "arm\_1\_joint" and the corresponding position sensor is named "arm\_1\_joint\_sensor".


Look for example into webots/projects/robots/pal\_robotics/tiago\_extensions/protos/TiagoFrontArm.proto


From the proto files.

##### mero 03/06/2020 16:10:39
from where can i get their names?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:10:12
The position sensors are different devices from the motors. They have a different name as well.

##### mero 03/06/2020 16:09:25
I used the names given in the webots sample for the tiago and initialized the device tags first.  This is the code:   for (int i = 0; i < N\_PARTS; i++) {

    robot\_parts[i] = wb\_robot\_get\_device(names[i]);

    wb\_motor\_set\_velocity(robot\_parts[i], wb\_motor\_get\_max\_velocity(robot\_parts[i])/2.0);

    wb\_position\_sensor\_enable(robot\_parts[i], 64);

  }

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 16:07:07
This is because your device tag is not properly initialized. You probably used a wrong name?

##### mero 03/06/2020 16:05:27
Hello, I am trying to get the current position of the joints in the hand of the tiago titanium after moving it. I tried using the wb\_position\_sensor\_enable() for all the joints in a loop but it gives me an error of invalid device tag.

Cool. Thank for the feedback!

##### Axel M 03/06/2020 15:03:20
Hi,

Can a supervisor controller change WorldInfo.gpsReference during the runtime, and if so, will the change be effective ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 13:54:21
You should probably resize sub-wheels as well.


This special friction is needed to simulate the asymmetric friction of the Mecanum wheels. See the documentation here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)

##### ptrepag 03/06/2020 13:40:19
`@Olivier Michel` thank you for the pointer on the WorldInfo node.  I was wondering where the special friction came from.  I am still very new to Webots, so I have some dumb questions.  If I want to resize the wheels, do I just change the size of the Cylinder bounding object?  Or do I also need to apply a sizing transformation elsewhere?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 09:42:09
Please follow instructions here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide#pycharm](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide#pycharm)

##### kimkim 03/06/2020 09:38:32
On mac, I want to find webot library for import this path with pycharm. Would you help me how to?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 03/06/2020 09:08:41
```c++
bool move_arms;
[...]
if (move_arms) {
  // control the arm movement
} else 
  gaitManager.step(basicTimeStep);
```


`@elkelkmuh`: you should call gaitManager.step() in a conditional test: when you want to move the arms, don't call it and when you want the robot to walk, call it.


`@elkelkmuh`: the gait manager controls the movements of the legs and the arms as well, so, you cannot move the arms while the robot is walking with the gait manager.  You should stop the gait manager to move the arms.


`@kevinW`: simulationReset should not crash Webots. If it does, please fill in a bug report on [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug\_report.md](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) with all the details allowing us to reproduce the crash.


`@ptrepag`: when importing the Mecanum wheels from the Kuka youBot, you should copy the WorldInfo node as it includes important parameters allowing the Mecanum wheels to work properly, in particular the ContactProperties.


`@coderrr`: Making the e-puck a supervisor should work. Did you try to save and restart Webots? Otherwise, you can add a GPS device to the e-puck to retrieve its position.


`@lench`: I would recommend to have a look at our pedestrian simulation in Webots/projects/humans/pedestrian/worlds/pedestrian.wbt. It's a Python controller, but doesn't use ROS. It shouldn't be difficult however to control it from ROS.

##### kevinW 03/06/2020 04:07:48
Hello everyone, I am doing Machine Learning on Webots, and have already made my custom robot, and my neural network. I just need to figure out how to reset the Robot..... I am using python, and the function: simulationReset() just crashes the whole program.   Next, I tried resetting all the positions, but the function setMFRotation(...) takes an index, and if I tried working with it, but failed. (i have 30 rotational motors).... Why is resetting the robot so complex?

Yes, once you have created and compiled the robot window, you should be able to select it from the `window` field o your robot.

##### Cohen 03/03/2020 14:46:02
ok, no menu to add it, just prepare the file and it's up and running then ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/03/2020 14:45:12
Hi `@Cohen` the choice is computed automatically depending on the robot-window found in the `plugins/robot_windows` folder of your project. You may also find some interesting information here:

`@David Mansolino` The program now works! But I still need a tiny winy bit of help if possible.

The 8.40 is not supportive of naoqi to work with softbank's softwere (8.2.1 was supportive but is not launching! due to a license requirement)



I found this on cyberbotic's git:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim](https://github.com/cyberbotics/naoqisim)



I followed instructions but msys2's console is not recognizing the command "make" and the .sln file won't complie on my visual studio since it is missing h files "alnaosim.h"

"alrobotmodel.h"



Any idea?

Thanks for the patience.


`@David Mansolino` I will have a look. If I'm not back that means it worked.

Hello guys

I've started learning webots a few weeks ago and I've gone through its tutorials and user guide quite extensively. I'm trying working with ROS

but when I run the following command in a terminal window:

roslaunch webots\_ros pioneer3at.launch

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 03/02/2020 06:37:06
`@User21` goal\_handle is a handle to the current target trajectory received. The last if should indeed be raised when the robot reaches the target position. Maybe the tolerance is to small, you may reduce the tolerance sent to the `within_tolerance` function. You may also print the difference between curent and target position to check what is hapenning exactly.

##### LaCava 03/01/2020 17:56:35
Wait

Just as I've sent that I remembered there are available 'slots', so I assume I can add non-colliding nodes there and just track those.


Hi all -- I'm trying to keep track of the position in space (X, Y, Z) of a few choice parts of a robot (Softbank NAO). I'm aware of the different spatial sensors, but I'm looking for a more direct way to track those values with a supervisor.

##### asphyxia 03/01/2020 17:29:54
Hello, I think I have found a race condition between `Supervisor::simulationReset()` and `Robot::tick()`. If `simulationReset()` is called before `tick()` (with a nonzero step), sometimes `tick()` will wait until the simulation time is `step` ms after the time *before* `simulationReset` was called, instead of `step` ms after time 0, causing the simulation to run for much more than `step` ms (e.g. if `simulationReset` is called at 5.000 seconds simulation time, and then `tick(32)` is called, `tick` will return after another 5 seconds - when the simulation time has gone from 0s up to 5.032s). I can't seem to reproduce this too reliably (I just ran a test 10 times, and the race happened twice); I'm using python 3.8 on a synchronized controller.

##### Deep 03/01/2020 12:57:02

##### User21 02/29/2020 15:49:10
When i test the code the last else function never gets called and throught that the goal\_handle.set suceeded never gets called. And to my knowledge is that the way i get the feedback if my robot reached the goal. Im quite confused about the variable goal\_handle because of his type. its either None or some sort of adress. maybe im just missing something. I hope you understand my problem.


`@David Mansolino` 

I dont understand the last function of the TrajectoryFollower code from the universal\_robots\_ros controller. These function gets called in the while loop of the universal\_robots\_ros python script and its executing planned path.

This function is not for setting the map position directly, but for acting on a joint position.

##### schadocalex 02/28/2020 11:41:48
Yes my models are not very low poly ones. Thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 11:38:25
No the PROTO works indeed only for trees (but you might get inspiration from it if needed), but if your original model contains many triangles then the Supervisor is indeed the way to go.

##### schadocalex 02/28/2020 11:35:42
Thanks for the fast answers.

Ok so Webots Supervisors are the way to do it.

About Forest PROTO, can I add my own tree types? Because it‚Äôs not really trees I want, I have my own custom models.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 11:20:46
`@schadocalex`, alternatively the `Forest` PROTO node allows you to define the position of a large number of three in a file in an efficient way: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-trees#forest](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-trees#forest)


`@User21` the workaround is to put your robot in the children field of another Robot node (whose controller is set to 'none') this way you have two independant rotation fields to manipulate. But it would be cleaner to handle rotation combination directly in your Supervisor.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 11:17:41
Hi `@schadocalex`, I believe the second option you propose is probably the best way to go. This script could actually be implemented as a Webots Supervisor. Also, instead of instantiating new models, it could simply move existing models (e.g., trees) that are already loaded in the world file.

##### schadocalex 02/28/2020 11:11:26
Hi, Webots is awesome! But I have a problem. I have a big world definition input, that say for example "one tree is at this position". I can have thousands of trees. I have two solutions, for both I can't find how to do it in Webots:

1) Generate a big world file and then load it. But there is no LOD or something so there will be too much objects in the scene, I think. Maybe I can make chunks of the maps and load them depending of my main robot pos? Is it possible?

2) Have a standalone script that instantiate models dynamically in the world, depending on robot pos.

Thanks!

##### User21 02/28/2020 11:06:46
Hey i have a Problem with the rotation of the ur5e. Can i predefine a rotation for that robot and then rotate it from there? I want to rotate the robot around the robots z Axis over a supervisor filed but its not that easy possible because i get multiple changes in the x,y,z rotations

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/28/2020 06:27:52
`@User21`, no problem, yes you can simply check if your action client state is succeded, see this example: [http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib#C.2B-.2B-\_SimpleActionClient](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib#C.2B-.2B-_SimpleActionClient)

I'm assuming having the ros libraries inside webots is to provide the ability to run a ros\_controller without having to source a workspace ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 15:14:06
It is indeed from kinetic


Perfect. In that case it means that the ros libraries shiped within webots are not compatible with the one you are using.

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 15:13:39
(i'm using melodic)


I guess the libraries you got in there are from kinetic release or something like this ?


`@David Mansolino` Yup that worked

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 15:01:30
`@User21`, I assume you are using the universal robot model and ROS1, right ?


Maybe that can be an explanation, because it adds `webots/projects/default/libraries/ros` to the path, maybe this cause library conflicts with your ros libraries. Can you try temporarily removing those libraries from `webots/projects/default/libraries/ros` ?


`@Axel M` Webots does indeed change the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, it adds some paths

##### User21 02/27/2020 14:31:07
Hi there,

im using moveit with webots, and i wanted to know if the trajectoryFollower gives me feedback if i reached my goal. I need to know because i want to use it as reason to exit a while loop.

Thanks for helping!

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 14:19:52
The only thing that comes to my mind would be a skewed LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH (As I have to set it in order to run the controller externally, maybe Webots override it and something happens with the shared libraries of ROS ?)


I don't know the "right" way to do it but in my case, it is compiled by a catkin CMakeLists where I added manually linking to libCppController


thanks `@David Mansolino` üôÇ I updated the snipped to a fully standalone controller code. However, it needs to be linked to ros librairies

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 14:05:32
Ok, thank you for this code snipet, I will try it as soon as I have a bit of time

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 14:04:56
Running externally time is running as expected ü§î


The real part is random while the decimal part always end identically


Timestamp output example : 3863553536.000032767


\#include <ros/ros.h>

\#include <iostream>

\#include <memory>

\#include <webots/Robot.hpp>



using namespace webots;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

    std::shared\_ptr<Robot> robot(new Robot());



    ros::init(argc, argv, "test\_node");

    ros::console::set\_logger\_level(ROSCONSOLE\_DEFAULT\_NAME, ros::console::levels::Debug);

    ros::NodeHandle nh;



    std::cout << "running test controller"

              << "\n";

    while (ros::ok() && robot->step(1000) != -1) {

        std::cout << ros::Time::now() << "\n";

        ros::spinOnce();

    }



    return 0;

}


In the end, my minimal code reproduction that demonstrate the problem is just :


The time is running in webots, yup


`@David Mansolino` No simulated time : so use\_sim\_time false, no /clock, and the timestamps are just plain random that goes from 1987 to 2090+

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 13:56:15
`@Axel M` that's strange, the behavior should be the same between intern and extern controllers. What kind og timestamps do you get? Is the time running in Webots? Are you publishing the clock topic? Are use setting 'use\_sim\_time'?


`@Oxygenious` you're welcome

##### Oxygenious 02/27/2020 13:49:27
`@David Mansolino` It works, thank you!

##### Axel M 02/27/2020 13:48:14
Hi, I've written a webots controller in Cpp which use roscpp lib internally. If I run the controller externally, everything is working perfectly. However, running the controller inside webots gives weird random (and constant) timestamps as output of ros::Time::now()

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/27/2020 13:38:25
Creo use the `Anchor` WRML node (amongst other) when exporting to WRML, unfortunately this node is not supported by Webots.

I suggest to use another tool to export as VRML, you can use for example this free online platform that export in a VRMl format compatible with Webots: [https://cloud.cadexchanger.com/app](https://cloud.cadexchanger.com/app)

##### Oxygenious 02/27/2020 13:27:49
Hi everyone,

I needed to import a 3D CAD to Webots, so i have exported a solid from Creo (Pro engineer) as VRML. However when i tried to import it in Webots nothing happens.

Hi `@David Mansolino`, from Webots the Supervisor is indeed the way to go. Alternatively, you can write a script (in python for example) that reads direct the world or PROTO file to extract the information.

Just by curiosity, why do you need to write this URDF description?

##### Francony 02/27/2020 10:57:10
Hi, I have a robot model in Webots and need to extract all of the node's positions/masses/inertias to write a URDF description of the robot. For this, I tried writing a supervisor controller that goes through all the nodes in the my tree but it's harder to navigate the nodes than I expected. Do you know of a more efficient way to do this? thanks in advance

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/26/2020 08:23:30
(It can be a passive motor)


To measure joint a joint between the two solid must be present, and the Motor API should be used.


Yes, it can measures 3D forces

##### jinu061353 02/26/2020 08:22:21

You're welcome

##### XZbot 02/26/2020 06:51:02
Thanks a lot `@David Mansolino`  I will try your method tomorrow

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/26/2020 06:48:56
`@XZbot`, you are almost there, the problem comes from the fact that the Supervisor class inherits from the Robot class, it is therefore sufficient to instantiate only the Supervisor class and use this instance instead of the robot instance, e.g.:

```Python
supervisor = Supervisor()
leftMotor = supervisor.getMotor('left wheel motor')
```


`@coderrr`, no. You should set the aperture from the scene-tree you can't change it from the API.


`@Valtteri Bottas`, it depends on the surface, there is no 'correct' global value for the columb friction.

##### Valtteri Bottas 02/25/2020 22:55:23
I have a general question. What is the most accurate value for columb friction to simulate?

##### XZbot 02/25/2020 20:30:13
How I changed the motor speed is using a Robot class:

    from controller import Robot

    ...



    robot = Robot() 

    leftMotor = robot.getMotor('left wheel motor')

    rightMotor = robot.getMotor('right wheel motor')

    leftMotor.setPosition(float('inf'))

    rightMotor.setPosition(float('inf'))

    leftMotor.setVelocity(0.0)

    rightMotor.setVelocity(0.0)

    ...



    ## Inside the while loop for each time step

       ...

       #modify speed

       leftSpeed = ...

       rightSpeed = ...



       # write actuators inputs

       leftMotor.setVelocity(leftSpeed)

       rightMotor.setVelocity(rightSpeed)

       ...





How I want to extract translation and rotation value while it's autonomously moving is to use a Supervisor class, which seems to be not compatible with a Robot class: 

    

    supervisor = Supervisor()

    robotNode = supervisor.getFromDef('E-puck')

    robotTranslationField = robotNode.getField('translation')

    robotRotationField = robotNode.getField('rotation')



    ## Inside the while loop for each time step

       ...

       #read translation and rotation values

       trans = robotTranslationField.getSFVec3f()

       rotat = robotRotationField.getSFRotation()


Hi David, I am working on a simulated maze experiment using Webots and I have a question regarding the extraction of ground-truth position of the robot during simulation. I put an e-puck in my maze and set it to start at a certain position by setting up the initial translation and rotation values under the E-puck node in the scene tree before starting simulation. In my controller code, at each simulation time step, I first extract the robot's distance sensor values, and use that to regulate its left motor and right motor speed when it moves inside the triple T maze. So the robot can now autonomously move inside the triple T-maze and turn properly at a corner or a T-intersection. My controller code is now able to extract useful sensor information and write to a csv file at each time step for each simulation trial. However, I cannot extract the translation and rotation values at each time step, although I can monitor them changing under the E-puck node in the scene tree during the simulation. The related code I have is shown below. Could you please give any suggestion of how to solve this problem? Thanks!

##### coderrr 02/25/2020 20:27:58
ds0 = robot.getDistanceSensor('ds0')

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 20:03:39
The value is not robot-dependant, but it is the DEF name that you defined (in your case probably 'ROBOT'). You can define the def name by selecting the node in the scene tree and then usinf the node editor: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor)

##### coderrr 02/25/2020 20:01:42
I am using khepera and e-puck. The parameter value will be 'e-puck' and 'khepera' or 'ROBOT'


supervisor = Supervisor()

`@David Mansolino` Thank you so much üòÅ


Okay

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 19:58:04
not exactly, once you did get the node, you can use it to get fields:

```
supervisor = Supervisor()
node = supervisor.getFromDef('...')
field = node.getField('translation')
translationValue = field.getSFVec3f()
```


supervisor = Supervisor()

node = supervisor.getFromDef('...')

##### coderrr 02/25/2020 19:53:02
what is equivalent to "wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def" in Python?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 19:52:56
`@coderrr` instead of instatiating a Robot class you should simply instantiate a Supervisor class (it inherits from the Robot class and provide all the Supervisor methods)

##### coderrr 02/25/2020 19:51:15

Hi `@kwy` yes of course, for pycharm we do provide a guide to set it up: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide#pycharm](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-your-ide#pycharm)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 08:46:54
Yes, this is a good approach. It depends on the complexity of the programs, but splitting them could also help making a better use of the PC's CPUs.

##### Axel M 02/25/2020 08:41:34
Thanks for your answer `@Stefania Pedrazzi`, do you recommend this approach though ? maybe some caveats appears when you run 12+ robot nodes ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 08:40:32
Hi `@Axel M`, only Robot nodes can run scripts or programs. But it is possible to have nested Robot nodes, i.e. you can add a Robot node as parent of your Camera node. Each Robot node, even if nested, runs independent programs, so you will be able to run a script just for the Camera.

##### Axel M 02/25/2020 08:36:40
Is it possible to "attach a script" to a Node which is not a robot ? I would love to have a process running on a camera (to emulate an HTTP server as we have on our real sensors). Is the right way to do this to encapsulate this server inside the robot or supervisor controller ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 07:43:28
Ok, in that case it should indeed work, for stopping it, as you can see in the doc ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#gait-manager](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robotis-op2#gait-manager)) there is a `stop()` function.

##### elkelkmuh 02/25/2020 07:41:25
`@David Mansolino` first I will use gaitmanager in webots for walking. Then I will stop gait manager. Finally I will control the motors of only arm. How can stop gait manager.I will not generate new gait manager.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/25/2020 06:34:08
`@elkelkmuh` in that case you have to develop your own gait algorithm (or improve the existing one) as the current gait algorithms impose the position of all the motors.


Hi `@coderrr`, yes you can specify the aperture using the `aperture` of the `DistanceSensor` node. See the documentation for more information: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/24/2020 13:18:46
`@User21` I have checked and on the Webots side the only thing you have to do is to make sure you use different prefixes in this launch file:  [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/resources/ros\_package/ur\_e\_webots/launch/ur5e\_joint\_limited.launch](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/resources/ros_package/ur_e_webots/launch/ur5e_joint_limited.launch)



For the rest, it is not really related to Webots, You should probably ask directly to [https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal\_robot](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) how you should do to control more than one arm.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/21/2020 16:40:50
Of course, you can scale down all the masses if you don't want to modify the `WorldInfo` parameters, that should be equivalent, but maybe misleading if you look at the masses of the model...


No need to reduce the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep` too much.


The boomer tractor is an example of an heavy weight vehicle: `webots/projects/vehicles/worlds/boomer.wbt` for which a number of `WorldInfo` parameters were adjusted to avoid getting the robot sinking into the ground. They are mainly `WorldInfo.ERP` and `WorldInfo.contactProperties.softCFM`. Playing with these values and going away from default value will make your simulation compliant with heavy weight vehicles.


There are other parameters which you can tune to allow for heavy weight models. Let me check it and I will revert back to you about it here...

##### Axel M 02/21/2020 16:32:42
How worth is it to simulate real weights of a somewhat massive robot ? Mine is about ~3 Tons and it's sinking into the ground even if I reduce basicTimeStep. I've tried the Model 3 Tesla Model, and it stop sinking into the ground at basicTimeStep ~= 2ms. I was wondering if, dividing all weights by 100 or 1000 in order to have a higher basicTimeStep was a valid approach (I imagine it to be a tradeoff between realistic forces / torques and simulation speed ?)

About the dumbell, a Transform is required because there is only one Solid node (the whole dumbell is considered as one single object), therefore the various part of this object (e.g. Shapes) needs to be encaspulated in a Transform otherwise they would all be centered at the origin of the Solid.


You're right about the cylinder rotation, I will add a not about this.


Let me check

##### Axel M 02/21/2020 13:44:16
I have some remarks / questions regarding Tutorial 6 (4-Wheels Robot):

- (Even if kind of obvious), the rotation of the cylinder modelling the wheels is not mentioned ( (0,0,1) 1.5707 ) 

- Why are the translations of the spheres in the dumbell (Tutorial 5) achieved via Transform Node, whereas in the Tutorial 6 they're done using the translation attribute of the wheel Solid Node ?

Hi `@mero`, welcome!

Webots does provide one hand gripper as example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators)

But I am sure many users created their own one

Are there r2020 ver2 in ubuntu(beta)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/21/2020 10:51:32
Ok, that can explain the problem, we just fixed an issue with the camera.saveImage function a feww weeks ago as explained in the changelog of de development version: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/docs/reference/changelog-r2020.md#webots-r2020a-revision-2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/docs/reference/changelog-r2020.md#webots-r2020a-revision-2)

Just for information, we are currently improving a lot the Webots-ROS2 interface, to have the latest improvement you can build the packages from sources from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2.git](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2.git)


This is indeed one possible solution!

##### Ultra\_LcD 02/19/2020 15:14:23
It's already done, I found the solution.  I've manually set the environment variable: export ROS2\_WEBOTS\_HOME=/usr/local/webots

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 15:10:35
Ok, the webots\_ros package doesn't include the Webots simulator (to be installed seperately), the simplest solution is to install the `webots_ros2_desktop` package from the package manager.

##### Ultra\_LcD 02/19/2020 15:09:37

Anybody have an idea ?

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:52:07
Okay, understood. You've been of  great help. Thank you `@Fabien Rohrer`

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:44:01
VRML does not contain data about physics, and meshes are not very stable in Webots. So I would say that critical geometries should be translated to simple primitives. In your case, I think that it's necessary to convert the wheels to cylinders, the caster wheels to spheres, and the gripper to (a set of) boxes. But the collisions over the body may be kept as a mesh.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:40:48
So, when I import a VRML file, I should use it only for defining geometry, however, I should use a primitive for defining the bounding object for better stability. I am getting this right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:38:06

I fixed several of these small issues, and I have now a working result, but perfectible. At least it's a new good starting sample for you.

`@sunnyjerai` 3. The biggest issue is certainly that the boundingObject of the gripper plate is a mesh. This primitive is not very stable. Replacing it by a box gives much better results.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:18:48
Okay, I'll try that as well

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:16:02
=> I'm giving a quick try to grip the object this way right now..


(Maybe that the gripper has too much force)


2. to control the gripper in force/torque mode rather in position mode.


1. do not use threads, especially to trigger the robot.step()


I also advise you to:


You should probably add a dummy boundingObject there, typically a sphere of radius 0.01

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 13:06:01
That is the turn Table mechanism, However, it has 3 children which have their own bounding object.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 13:04:02
There is a Solid without boundingObject. That can cause issues

Yes , sure

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 12:48:35
could you send your world here?


it seems there is an issue somewhere.


but the result in your movie seems to contradict this.


yes, -1 is supposed to give an infinite friction.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 12:45:12
As of now, the coulombFriction between the gripper contact material and object contact material is -1(for infinity)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/19/2020 12:45:10
2 is twice bigger.


The default friction is ContactProperty.coulombFriction = 1.


To do so, you need to specify the Solid.contactMaterial fields, and then to define the WorldInfo.contactProperty for each couple of materials.


You should check that you defined well the friction.


`@sunnyjerai` difficult to answer without looking at the simulation file, but it seems that the friction object-gripper and object-ground is extremely low, rather than infinity as you claim.

##### sunnyjerai 02/19/2020 12:39:25
Can someone help me figure out why object keeps slipping. I've set the friction between the gripper and the object to infinity so that they won't slip. The object mass is 0.1 Kg and the robot can easily push the object.

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:26:25
I don't know if its any extra help but, upon further investigation, i see that i changed the world file in the sphero/worlds and also added an extra texture in the same directory. Apparently that and updating to the new version broke the loading of the robot completely (even from other separate custom projects). Both the world and the texture files were not removed during uninstall. Thanks again.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:18:41
ok, thank you for info. We will try to improve it. We already know that there are some issues uninstalling Webots on windows if the installation directory has been modified manually by the user. In fact this is not recommended.

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:17:22
Also i didn't mess with the bb-8 file but added some textures in the worlds directory

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:15:37
OK. the error I mentioned it is not prompt in a new window, but in the logs area of the the installer report. Of course prompting it in a new window would be much more visible.

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:14:11
I think i would remember if it threw an error when i updated, i don't think it did. It threw an error after the uninstall process now though.

Ok now bb-8 is loaded properly. The problem seemed to be on my end, where I might have changed something that i don't remember and then updating to the new version broke it. I completely removed any related webots files and reinstalled and now it works. Thank you!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 09:06:20
`@User21` ok in that case you are using ROS1, in that case you should be able to use the RVIZ and Moveit from the 'MoveIt! with a simulated robot' part documented here: [https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal\_robot/blob/kinetic-devel/README.md](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/blob/kinetic-devel/README.md)

(after starting the simulation with `roslaunch ur_e_webots ur5.launch` ).

##### Lifebinder (tsampazk) 02/19/2020 09:01:24
this file is present in that path, maybe something went wrong on the installation of the new version over the old one? I'll try reinstalling and will get back to you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/19/2020 08:53:22
I just tried on Windows with R2020a rev1 and it is working fine for me.

Can you check if you have the BB-8 PROTO file in `WEBOTS_HOME/projects/robots/sphero/bb8/protos/BB-8.proto`?

If this is not the case, can you please try uninstalling and re-installing Webots?


Hi `@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` , let me check if I can reproduce this

I want to give the Ur5e more the one Positions for my endeffector. At the end i want to move my endeffector to a coordinate and then i want him to wait a few seconds. After that it should move to another position.

It works for the first coordinate but after that it move uncontrollable through the world. After some time it moves to the second position. 

Did someone make some experience with controlling the ur5e with moveit over a c++ or python script?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 15:41:57
`@sunnyjerai`, I checked your model, and the problem is that the sliders of the gipper are not childrens of the 'Table' solid. I will send you a fixed version by mail. Note also that you should probably improve your bounding objects to use sets of basic geometries instead of indexedFaceSet, this will make the simulation run faster and more stable.

(you can add a group to create a composed boundign object)


The boudning object should be defined in the 'SOLID1+2' Solid

##### yash 02/18/2020 15:04:03
But then def shape will not have option for bounding object !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 14:16:51
In that case, yes, you can do as `@Olivier Michel` said, it will result in something like:

```

    DEF SHAPE1 Shape {
      ...
    }

So should I still proceed as you instructed .?


`@Olivier Michel`  I tried doing it .... but one solid has hinge joint and one is just a solid

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 12:01:09
E.g., 
```
DEF SOLID1 Solid {
  children [
    DEF SHAPE1 Shape {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
DEF SOLID2 Solid {
  children [
    DEF SHAPE2 Shape {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```



Is merged this way:



```
DEF SOLID1+2 Solid {
  children [
    DEF SHAPE1 Shape {
      ...
    }
    DEF SHAPE2 Shape {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```


`@yash`: you can simply put all the Shapes nodes as the children of the same Solid.

Hello, i'm using a supervisor node to reset a robot controller. The supervisor node and the robot node communicate with receivers/emitters both ways. They work ok up until i reset the robot controller



After resetting the robot controller and it is restarted and properly broadcasting, it seems that the supervisor receiver stops receiving the messages (the queue length stays at 0). After several steps the supervisor receiver starting picking up the messages the old messages (after reset) in order, thus they get badly desynchronized. The send method in the robot emitter properly returns 1.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/18/2020 06:33:49
`@Luiz Felipe`, in that  case, restarting the controllers ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_restart\_controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_restart_controller)) wouldn't be enough?


`@paulthemagno` In that case you should probably use this instead:

```
for x in range(0, 3):
  robot.fowards.play()
  robot.step(32)
  while not robot.fowards.isOver():
    robot.step(32)
```

##### Luiz Felipe 02/18/2020 02:50:23
My problem is similar I guess... I want to restart a simulation from a timestep, but keeping the inertia, velocities, and relocating the robots to the positions they were at that timestep (kind of a 'replay' or 'rewind function')... And start to explore again with my robots or repeat the same behavior from that 'point'/'checkpoint'... Is it possible to reset the simulation in this way? I see that when i save an html 5 animation I generate a json with rotation and translation parameters...


`@paulthemagno` I think this function can help: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_reset\_physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_reset_physics) ... before you reset physics you probably should set the translation and rotation of your robot node with setSFVec3f(translation) and setSFRotation(rotation)

##### paulthemagno 02/18/2020 01:22:48
> You are completely correct.

> HOwever, time.sleep(5) will not help as it will make the controller wait, but not the simulation runs. As a first step try to call instead `robot.step(5000)`.

`@David Mansolino` Thank you very much David, it works! Can I ask if there is a way to automatically shift the robot to a certain position whithout steps? Because I have to run several epochs and the robot has to begin from the same position at the beginning of each epoch

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/17/2020 19:24:48

You are completely correct.

HOwever, time.sleep(5) will not help as it will make the controller wait, but not the simulation runs. As a first step try to call instead `robot.step(5000)`.

`@David Mansolino` Thank you David. I'm trying to do as you said but I'm founding difficoulties on more than 1 consecutive steps: I put in a for the api motion.play() to do it more times. Unfortunately the nao only does the first step, but not the other ones. I think it's beacuse motion.play() only make the movement start, but doesn't wait the end of the command. Not sure if it's so. It seems that every movement is launched almost together and it takes only the first. I try to put a time.sleep(5) between every method but it didn't changhed

`@David Mansolino` sorry for the questions about Nao in the server. I have already seen both the [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions) files and the link you have posted ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion?tab-language=python)). Anyway I don't find a way for my purpose: I have a virtual map and I should synchronize it with the map of Webots. For my project the Nao has to make little steps. To make the map in Webots be the same of my virtual map, I should know how long is its step or how to change it. In this way I can change the size of the squares of the chessboard, to make the nao be at the center of a square at the end of any step. How can I do that?

Hi `@User21`, this examples lets you control the robot using 'FollowJointTrajectoryAction' action (named `follow_joint_trajectory`). The state of the joints is published in the `/joint_states` topic.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 02/17/2020 07:10:17
`@Nocturnal Warfare` unfortunately VRML files  (.wrl) can only be imported at the root node. But if your CAD model has a top node and in the VRML file this top node disappears and all the parts are defined as sibling nodes, then there is probably an problem with the VRML exporter. Not sure if this would work in your applications, but an alternative to copy and paste the nodes individually could be to add an additional parent node before exporting the VRML or if it doesn't work to add a parent node directly in the generated VRML file.

I had a question about importing my CAD .wrl into my simulation. When importing VRML file into webots, is there anyway to import it directly into the child of my robot? When I import it seems to import almost every part individually, and it throws all of the transforms into the main directory that has my WorldInfo, Floor, etc. Alternatively is there any easier way to copy those imported transforms into my robot over copying and pasting each one individually?

Hello

`@David Mansolino`  Thank you. I started to review the file.  I will do it all step by step. hope it works.

You should probabyl get insipration from the installation steps from the README file fo this erpo: [https://github.com/darwinop/webots-cross-compilation](https://github.com/darwinop/webots-cross-compilation)

##### elkelkmuh 02/12/2020 09:14:45
`@David Mansolino`  Do you have any advice?

For example, I recovered the robot and turned it back to its original settings.

Can you write the steps I can follow for the post?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/12/2020 08:55:56
Hi again `@elkelkmuh`, you should probably try to understand and fix the compilation problem on the robot directly (without usign Webots in a first step). Once this is working you should retry with the Webots interface.

##### elkelkmuh 02/12/2020 08:49:40
> `@elkelkmuh` I think you should summarize in a concise way the current issue you are trying to solve,  and do hypothesis by yourself, and come here in a second step, where you identified well the issue.

`@Fabien Rohrer` Actually, I do not have any problems in programming. Problem: I cannot run webots and op2 together. I think I will try to solve the problem myself.

yeah i think that makes sense, thank you

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/12/2020 08:06:40
`@Nocturnal Warfare` Looking at that quickly, I would create a Webots controller in Python which would simply open an UDP server, and wrap the simulated drone API with the DroneKit protocol. Then a regular dronekit script ([https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python#getting-started](https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python#getting-started)) could connect to this "fake" server to dialog with it as it is a real drone. Therefore, the main difficulty of such wrapper would be to mimic perfectly the DroneKit protocol. Does this make sense?

##### elkelkmuh 02/12/2020 08:04:37
`@David Mansolino`  I can not find how to solve the problem, can you help me?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 02/12/2020 08:00:47
Are there any resources on how I would start making such a wrapper?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/12/2020 07:56:33
`@Nocturnal Warfare` Hi. In my knowledge, there is unfortunately no interface between Dronekit and Webots. It is clearly possible to implement a wrapper between them.

Hi `@David Mansolino`  , I tried the framework at this address (  [https://sourceforge.net/p/darwinop/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/darwin/](https://sourceforge.net/p/darwinop/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/darwin/) )

 I get errors when I  installed this.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/12/2020 06:23:10
HI `@threeal`, by default Webots uses (10, 0, 0). Note also that there is a difference between Webots and the robotis motors, Webots does a control in speed regulation whereas robotis motors do a control on torque regulation.

##### threeal 02/11/2020 18:18:56
hi there, in webots documentation, it said that webots use pid controller to control the motor position ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#field-summary](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#field-summary).)

but how is the exact pid system in that motor controller? like in the robotis's motor it said this specification fo the controller system ([http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/#p-gain](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/#p-gain)), but when i see the default pid controller in robotis darwin op demo it use (8 0 0), is it the right value in webots?

##### Gautier A. 02/10/2020 16:21:54
(and I can't use "getPositionSensor()" because it's not a position sensor in the robot, but in another robot that is the children of that first robot)


Basically, I have a proto with a robot inside. I have position sensors on that robot. I made them visible in the scene tree by declaring a field in the proto heading. Now, I have a handler to the node, but I can't seem to be able to activate these position Sensor and retrieve their value ?


Is it possible to call function specific to its type (in my case, a position sensor) through the variable (that is an "handler on a node") ?


I have a handler on an node, through a supervisor. This node is a position sensor.

Abotu your other problem, you are not allowed to insert a Robot node in a Solid node. The workaround is to create your box node from a Robot node and simply setting the `controller` field to `none`.


Hi `@kadeng`, to fix the box to the floor the simplest (and better) way to do is simply to remvoe the Physics node of the box (but not the boundingObject).

`@User21`, not out of the box, but you can of course build your own gripper.


`@sunnyjerai` unfortunately not, you can change the intensity of the red, green and blue component independently but this will of course change the color too.


`@kadeng` note that arbitrary collision shapes using indexedFaceSet are working but way less efficient and stable than using a set of basic geometries.


`@Gman`, `@ƒ∞chigogo` is completely right, you can use the emitter-receiver mechanism, find an example in this sample simulation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#emitter\_receiver-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#emitter_receiver-wbt)


`@ian_lau` you can get the field of view with this this function: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb\_range\_finder\_get\_fov](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb_range_finder_get_fov) 

Then you can get the resolution with these functions: 

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb\_range\_finder\_get\_width](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb_range_finder_get_width)

Finally, you can compute the vertical field of view from the horizontal one and the resolution by using the fact that pixel are exactly squarre.

You might also be interested of gettign the maximum range of the range-finder:

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb\_range\_finder\_get\_max\_range](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rangefinder#wb_range_finder_get_max_range)****


You can also use a `runtime.ini` file in your controller folder to define this variable: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#environment-variables](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#environment-variables)


`@sujit`, you should be able to use your library (Tkinter) without copying it, just make sure its path is included in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

As far as I can tell, at least.

Alternatively, if you define the `WEBOTS_ALLOW_MODIFY_INSTALLATION` environment variable, Webots will not change the wbproj file: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/07d7ca6722139cec1415a7d3e308c298512b3124/src/install\_scripts/bashrc.linux#L12](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/07d7ca6722139cec1415a7d3e308c298512b3124/src/install_scripts/bashrc.linux#L12)

`@David Mansolino` Cool thank you. I do not see the wbproj file. It seems to be world related and may update on changing e.g. the view of in WeBots but not the files. Is it good or bad practice to add it to gitignore?

##### yunus [Moderator] 02/07/2020 15:24:15
`@kwy` I have not yet used Webots on mac, but I am sure you must install ROS first before you can use "ros python". This is true for Windows, Linux and mac also. The latest ROS distribution called Melodic can be installed on mac according to this official ROS page: [http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/macOS/Homebrew/Source](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/macOS/Homebrew/Source)

##### kwy 02/07/2020 14:12:15
I just tried to run the project "ros python" on mac. But i get a WARNING: ros\_python: Forced termination (because process didn't terminate itself after 1 second).  That means i need to install ROS ?

##### kadeng 02/07/2020 14:11:32
`@David Mansolino` BTW just to let you know. I gave up on building roscpp and related libraries in msys. This is probably a ton of work. You would have to either get catkin to run properly in msys (which requires *reverting* a lot of the special treatment for Windows. Or, most likely much easier, put all of the  sources into one big library and build a dll from it. The thing is, roscpp pulls in a lot of other ROS components.

##### yunus [Moderator] 02/07/2020 13:58:17
Just as an additional remark: before rospy on Webots can work, I had first to install ROS for Windows using the steps on this link: [http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows](http://wiki.ros.org/Installation/Windows), (the last step is to create that shortcut file that you will call "ROS", and when you type "roscore" in it, it should show you no error. This indicates that ROS has been correctly installed)


`@David Mansolino` thank you, I just realized you've answered the question before me üôÇ


`@kadeng` The rospy library comes directly installed in Webots on this path `C:\Program Files\Webots\projects\languages\ros\controllers\ros_python`

If you go to Webots, Files > Open Sample World, then browse to: languages > ros > ros\_python.wbt you will see a sample world with a Thymio robot having a controller "ros\_python" that creates some ROS topics "motor" and "sensor". After you open that sample world, you should be able to see the sensor values being published on the Webots console. That's how you know ROS is working.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/07/2020 13:45:20
`@kadeng`: it is distributed within Webots in: `projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python`

##### yunus [Moderator] 02/07/2020 12:43:21
`@kadeng` yes, there is no ros.exe for Windows, I noticed that too. And as `@David Mansolino` pointed out. I am using that costum ros controller with rospy, and it works. Hopefully the roscpp will be complied for Windows and supported in future Webots releases.

Hi `@zibz` you can use any image processing library you want, here is how to integrate it in C/C++ for example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)


`@kadeng`, I just cheked and you are right, the Windows version of the ros controller is not available anymore because we have issues recompiling the  ros/rocpp\_core, roscpp and rosconsole with mingw64 (but this is for sure doable, we just hadn't time to do this).

However, on Windows you might use the python API to communicate with Webots from ROS: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#custom-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#custom-ros-controller)

> I was wondering whether it would be possible to get it to run on Windows (acting as a client to a Linux VM running ROS)

If you manage to recompile it for Windows (I did it a long time ago, but it is not working with the newer version of Webots), it should be possible indeed.


HI `@kadeng` yes it is open source, the code is here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros)

Abotu the Makefiles, you are probably refeering to: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/Makefile](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/default/libraries/Makefile)

This makefiles only download the dependencies of the controller (libros.dll etc.),

##### kadeng 02/06/2020 13:41:34
I was wondering whether it would be possible to get it to run on Windows (acting as a client to a Linux VM running ROS)


Does anyone know if the source code of the standard ros controller for webots is open source? Seems like it is a precompiled library that is being downloaded via the Makefile


I would recommend to use printf debugging (write a log files with timestamps) to isolate the delay.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/06/2020 13:23:34
About the reason of the delay, it is diffcult to say, because you have many conversion from one framework to the other. Webots->ROS->Simulink->Ros->Webots


Hi `@yunus` the ros controller is suppose to be in `C:/Program Files/Webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/` can't you see any ros.exe there? If not re-installing Webots might fix the problem.

##### yunus [Moderator] 02/06/2020 13:16:02
Hello. On the same subject of using ROS. I am trying to use ROS to communicate commands from MATLAB Simulink to a Khepera III in Webots. All is running on Windows 10. I used 'rospy' Python controller in Webots and it works, but there is at least 20 seconds latency between when I send the Simulink command and when the robot starts moving. So I am thinking of using 'ros' controller to get around this problem of asynchronous response (*as I think C codes are faster to compile than Python's*). However, when I open any sample world that uses 'ros', I get this error:

`WARNING: Robot: The controller directory has not been found, searched the following locations:

C:/Program Files/Webots/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros/

C:/Program Files/Webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/

C:/Program Files/Webots/resources/projects/controllers/ros/`

Can you please give me some advice?

And what possibly you think is the reason why my Webots simulation doesn't run immediately as I press run on my Simulink simulation?

##### kwy 02/06/2020 11:45:12

You could even think about running ROS in a linux virtual machine on mac üòâ


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller)


You should use this parameter: ROS\_MASTER\_URI:


Yes, it seems to be possible. But in any case, the ROS node should run in Linux. But Webots can run on macOS.

##### kwy 02/06/2020 11:33:10
ok.  when I create a simulation, i need to run ROS and Webots on Linux. after i finish the simulation,  then i can run the simulation directly on mac. Right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/06/2020 11:31:06
You just need to set your Robot.controller field to "ros"


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/default/controllers/ros)


it can be run in every simulation (as it's a default controller):


The client ROS controller is called "ros"


This should run out-of-the-box in Webots.

##### kwy 02/06/2020 11:28:21
Oh! that is perfect. so i need to download the ROS client?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/06/2020 11:26:14
If I'm not wrong, ROS itself cannot run on macOS. You should think about running it on linux. However, the ROS client which interfaces Webots and ROS can run on macOS. Therefore your simulation may run on macOS.

Is there any way to convert automatically the proto in base node (through supervisor or other) ? We use a supervisor to instantiate the different proto at the beginning of the simulation, so we try to "minimize user input".


Ok, that's good new, thank you a lot !

And you can follow the progress of [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1310](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1310)


In the meantime, I would recomment to convert your PROTO temporarly to base node, you can easily do this by right-clicking on your PROTO node and selecting `Convert to Base Node(s)`


Unfortunately this is a known limitation, but the good news is that we have plans for improving this in a near future: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1310](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1310)

It could be plugged in any other robot, or your own one.

##### kadeng 02/05/2020 06:57:16
Physical simulation accuracy is also important, since the robot is for a plugging task.


Well, I am currently trying to design a custom robot which also has an UR5 robotic arm attached for simulation in Gazebo. Installed the Phobos plugin in Blender and tried to get things working. But noticed that basically not much is working as documented, docs are bad and out of date, exceptions keep popping up. Then this morning I found webots..

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 02/05/2020 06:56:15
It has obvious advantages over Gazebo: it runs smoothly on Windows/macOS, it is deterministic, it provides a realistic rendering, its physics engine and collisions are better, it provides web streaming features, etc.


We could try to provide you more precise answer on specific topics.


`@kadeng` Difficult to have an impartial answer here, but Webots is much more mature IMO. Certainly because of its close source history (before being released open source).

`@David Mansolino` But if I just add joint in trajectory\_folloer.py so arm joints and gripper joint will all publish to topic /follow\_joint\_trajectory. I want use /arm\_control/follow\_joint\_trajectory for arm and /gripper\_contraol/follow\_joint\_trajectory

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/04/2020 08:50:02
About the trajectory\_follower.py it is probabyl simpler to just add the name to the `jointNames` array


You therefore have to create yourself the model. For this you can use our urdf importer: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/urdf2webots)


We don't have the 85 model, only the 3F one: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators#robotiq-3f-gripper](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/gripper-actuators#robotiq-3f-gripper)

##### rachel 02/04/2020 08:07:25
Hello `@David Mansolino`. Thank yo for your response. I will explain what I already did. According to robotiq 85 simulation in Gazebo [https://github.com/StanleyInnovation/robotiq\_85\_gripper/blob/master/robotiq\_85\_simulation/robotiq\_85\_gazebo/controller/gripper\_controller\_robotiq.yaml](https://github.com/StanleyInnovation/robotiq_85_gripper/blob/master/robotiq_85_simulation/robotiq_85_gazebo/controller/gripper_controller_robotiq.yaml) The gripper is only controlled by one joint "gripper\_finger1\_joint". So I added this joint in the file  [https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5\_2f\_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/joint\_state\_publisher.py](https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5_2f_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal_robots_ros/joint_state_publisher.py) which is this file [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/joint\_state\_publisher.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/joint_state_publisher.py). And I modify the file [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/trajectory\_follower.py](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/trajectory_follower.py). You can find here [https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5\_2f\_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/trajectory\_follower.py](https://github.com/ipa-rwu/ur5_2f_webots/blob/master/controllers/universal_robots_ros/trajectory_follower.py). Could you have look the file I modify? I am not so sure how to write FollowJointTrajectoryAction for gripper in Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/04/2020 06:35:19
Hi again `@rachel`, for ROS1 our interface with the FollowJointTrajectory action is limited to the univrsal robot robots. It is implemented in this controller: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros)

It should be quite easy to extend it to the gripper too. It is just a metter of adding the names of the gripper motors:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal\_robots/controllers/universal\_robots\_ros/joint\_state\_publisher.py#L24](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/universal_robots/controllers/universal_robots_ros/joint_state_publisher.py#L24)

I just checked them, there are indeed never freed but they are unique and used during the whole life of the controller, so you can safely ignore these warnings

And there might be other options as well


This can also be controllex with rqt trajectory planner


If you just go to Universal Robots ROS driver github pacakage you can find a couple of exaoles there


This is an action server you have to write an action client which will talk to the server and get the job done


There is one Robotiq package in ROS have a look at that

##### Gautier A. 02/03/2020 10:54:46

Oh, I see


Basically, I want to use a lua library to load a config file when the proto is being loaded, but I want the user to be able to modify its value later

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 10:54:16
For this iteration yes, but not for the next regeneration.

##### Gautier A. 02/03/2020 10:53:47
But the change will be taken "into account" when the proto is being generated ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 10:53:11
You can change the `fields.variableName.value` value, but unfortunately this will not be visible in the scene-tree (this possibility is not yet implemented).

##### Gautier A. 02/03/2020 10:52:18
Hi David, I would like it to change the value of its own field, visible in the scene tree (the value we access through "fields.variableName.value")

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 10:51:10
Hi `@Gautier A.` you mean you want a procedural PROTO to change the value of its own field visible in the scene tree or change the value of one of its internal fields?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 02/03/2020 06:47:53
`@SimonDK` how did you installed Python? Make sure to not use Python from brew or other, Webots will work only with the one downloaded on python.org. See this related post: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59840278/running-an-external-python-controller-from-console](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59840278/running-an-external-python-controller-from-console)


`@shivajitheboss`, unfortunately we don't have any way of transferrign to arduino out of the box. But since both Webots and arduino support C like language it should be quite easy to adapt your code from one to the other.


Hi `@w3. eydi` Welcome üòâ


`@MohammadSorush` you can find some information in the dataseets of the device (e.g. [http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64/)).

However, some of these parameters depends on the configuration of your robot (i.e. to what is connected the device) and not only the motor itself.

##### SimonDK 02/01/2020 14:57:16
Not entirely sure what is going on, but looking at the Webots source it is built against the python version living in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework, which seems to not be recommended in newer MacOS versions. Most people recommend to remove that python directory if it is there, and on MacOS Catalina the folder does not exist.


Running WeBots on Mac and using Python 3.7 I get the following error:

`import \_controller  ImportError: dlopen(/Applications/Webots.app/lib/controller/python37/\_controller.so, 2): 

Library not loaded: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/Python  

Referenced from: /Applications/Webots.app/lib/controller/python37/\_controller.so  

Reason: image not found`



Python 3.7 is available on the system but is not located at the path above i.e. /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework ... That path does not exist.



Should I install Python from the Python website or what is expected to use the Webots python libraries?

The robot itself has some inertia, but on the motor side the wheel instantaneously rotate at the desired speed. It would be nice to valibrate this, but I don't have access to the real robot to test this yet.


`@Dorteel` yes indeed the acceleration was not calibrated and is therefore set to infinity for now.

##### Dorteel 01/29/2020 13:58:54
I'm wondering if the robot has any momentum we should account for. If we're moving backwards  with max speed and the next velocity command is moving forward with max speed, do we just move forward with max speed in the next timestep? Or is there some momentum involved?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/27/2020 11:01:24
You can easily mount your UR5e arm on a linear slider. To do so, just add a Robot node with a SliderJoint, and mount your arm as a children of this node.

##### Mic.lop 01/27/2020 10:40:01
Hey everyone! Im a developer trying to use the software to make a simulation of a 3d printing factory. I began using the UR5e model to start. But quickly realize it would be tricky since I do not have the linear sliders available, so I am trying to go with the kuka youbot. However, I will need to stack printers on top of each other (they are big 1m¬≥). So I wanted to get the opinion of someone regarding what could be a quicker fix to have a mobile robot managing a matrix of 3 x 3 x3 printers ?

hello i have a problem in webots, i used to work with C++ i didn't have any problems, now that i want to work with python also i changed my laptop so i reinstalled webots (so we're sure the old configurations on c++ aren't there it's virgin xD) long story short, when i launch the simulation i get error message

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/25/2020 07:23:49
Hi `@enescan`  you can export your robot in VRML from SolidWorks and then import this VRML file in Webots directly (not that this will import only the shapes, you will then have to add solids, bounding objects, physics, sensors, etc.). Or import from SolidWorks to Blender and then Blender to Webots, here is an example with Autodesk Inventor  (Solidworks works similarly): [https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4](https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4)


`@ƒ∞chigogo`, it is not 'extend' but 'extern'


Hi `@FB`, you can download the latest version of Webots from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1)

And older release from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2019a](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2019a)

##### FB 01/25/2020 06:36:27
how can I download it?


this link:Windows: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/archive/windows/webots-7.4.0\_setup.exe](https://www.cyberbotics.com/archive/windows/webots-7.4.0_setup.exe)


hi  I want to install software Webots but the link dosn't exist

##### enescan 01/25/2020 02:09:32
Hello, I'm Enes from istanbul technical university. I have quick question. Is there any chances to get our 3d desinged robot (on solidworks) to webots simulation. If exist any tutorials will be best for me. thanks for answering

##### ƒ∞chigogo 01/25/2020 00:23:34
Now I chose car's controller as <extend> like in the tutorial but it says there is no extend controller üò≠ 



<< When I try to use pycharm it gives error as " ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found "  How can I solve it? ü•∫  ( I'm using Windows with Python 3.7)



Okay I solved it I don't know if I did correct thing but I'm sharing because I saw that some people couldn't solve it like me. I added path variable to

 C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\scripts;C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\lib\controller\python37;C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin



And lastly I added my project file's location to the Path.  >>

I'll look into that, thanks for the pointer!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 13:36:36
Hi `@Willem3141` not as I now, but you can automatically start the remote control mode when you start the controller with this function: `wb_robot_set_mode` ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_mode))

##### Willem3141 01/24/2020 13:33:47
Is there a way to keep e-pucks connected via Wi-Fi when reloading the world or resetting the simulation? Or alternatively, to automatically reconnect them? (Background: We had some student teams working on shape formation algorithms with many e-pucks, and while debugging the controller they had to reconnect to all the e-pucks every time they wanted to change something in the controller and reload, which really takes a lot of time...)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 13:32:05
You're welcome

##### Ross 01/24/2020 13:32:00
Okay thank you so much!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 13:31:14
Then if you have any specific question about Lidar do not hesitate to ask.


`@Ross` in that cas I strongly recommend to start with the official tutorial (at least 1 to 6): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

They are not strictly related to Lidar, but will give you a good overview of how Webots works and how to use the various sensors of Webots.

##### Ross 01/24/2020 13:29:09
I am a beginner and I don't know how to start off.. Like I know how to code in python and C++..but I know jackshit about how to go ahead and make the Lidar simulation.. :/

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 13:27:41
`@Ross` yes of course, what is your issue?

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:27:18

yes, I see that

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:25:54
in your control code you've got to enable the recogniser seperately

##### zibz 01/24/2020 13:25:36
thank you for replies


just had to add it

##### zibz 01/24/2020 13:24:49
kay, done that, gonna fiddle with it

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:23:52
`@zibz` you need to have your camera node in your PROTO file and then you need to set up the recognition field e.g.

##### zibz 01/24/2020 13:20:29
that's the context


hence was trying to understand what would the best approach be to have such feature on a controller


don't seem to have such node


so to distinguish objects in world


with the camera


am trying to use features of a Recognition node

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/24/2020 13:00:24
How you process an image world depends on what it is that you're trying to do. When you say image recognition do you mean using the webots  recognition feature or something else?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 12:05:53
ok, thanks


if I cant enable that, how can I process image?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 12:04:00

thx


kay, spot on probably

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 12:03:19
This is required because the image is updated only at the step (before it is None).

##### zibz 01/24/2020 12:02:46
no

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 12:02:19
Did you call the robot.step function BEFORE the first for?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 12:01:34
it's enabled and attached to display, can see rendered images

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/24/2020 12:00:48
How did you enable the camera? Did you call the robot.step function before ?

##### zibz 01/24/2020 12:00:44
that's the correct object reference


subscripting NoneType Object


image = self.camera.getImageArray()



        #display the components of each pixel

        for x in range(self.camera.getWidth()):

            for y in range(self.camera.getHeight()):

                red = image[x][y][0]

                green = image[x][y][1]

                blue = image[x][y][2]

                gray = (red + green + blue) / 3

Supervisor is a subclass of Robot.


yes, exactly.

##### JC 01/23/2020 16:59:13
oh i see, i thought of it like an add on to an existing robot but its more like a robot instance with more functionality

All the robot API is accessible from a Supervisor instance.


Ok, please do not create a Robot() instance then.

##### JC 01/23/2020 16:56:14

Great, that clears things up! Thanks once again!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 09:10:45
Yes it seems indeed.

##### Dorteel 01/23/2020 09:10:20
ah I see. So it's actually physically not possible to have both of them set to the max a the same time, right?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 09:09:17
I am sorry but from the datasheets of the motor ([http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl430-w250/](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl430-w250/)) it say maximum speed is 61 [rev/min] which is way lower than  12.64 rad/sec.

##### Dorteel 01/23/2020 09:08:13
if I'm setting linear and angular velocities  to the max in ROS, then I should get the maximum velocity of a wheel corresponding to 12.64 rad/sec. Using the model in the screenshot

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 09:05:47
You mean if the robot is going at the maximum forward speed and rotating in the same time?

##### Dorteel 01/23/2020 09:04:55
However if I set the motors to both the maximum linear and angular velocity, then the maxVelocity should be around 12.65 if I'm not mistaken


Hi guys! Referring to my earlier problem with the angular and linear velocity of the TurtleBot 3 Burger, I've noticed that the maxVelocity is set to 6.66 rad/sec corresponding to the maximum linear velocity of 0.22 m/s of the real robot.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/23/2020 06:57:10
Hi `@yunus`, this is indeed a format issue. Your are almost correct, the only issue is that mygps.getValues() returns an array and not a Vector3, here is a more correct version:

```
mygps = robot.getGPS('gps')
mygps.enable(timeStep)
...
GPSpub = rospy.Publisher('mygps',Vector3, queue_size=10)
...
# in the control loop
gpsValues = mygps.getValues()
GPSpub.publish(Vector3(x=gpsValues[0], y=gpsValues[1], z=gpsValues[2]))
```

##### yunus [Moderator] 01/23/2020 05:32:59
Hello. I am using **rospy **in Webots to communicate with Simulink. I added a GPS device to my Khepera robot by adding it as node in the TurretSlot field in the scene tree. In the controller, I have enabled GPS like this:

`mygps = robot.getGPS('gps')`

`mygps.enable(timeStep)`

`......`

`GPSpub = rospy.Publisher('mygps',Vector3, queue_size=10)`

and inside the control loop, I added a line"

`GPSpub.publish(mygps.getValues())`



The error I get is in the control loop, and the useful info in it says:

`.............

Invalid number of arguments, args should be ['x', 'y', 'z'] args are([-0.01999999987308264, -0.00011893769370018015, -0.125],)

............`

PS: Those three numerical value above are the exact GPS location, so I know at least that it reads them, but I think it's not correctly formatted. Thank you for pointing to me the mistake.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/22/2020 08:47:47
Perfect, thank you for the feedback !

It seems indeed that there is an issue, the 'Maximum rotational velocity' was used to compute the maximum wheel speed instead of the 'Maximum translational velocity'.


Hi `@Dorteel` let me check this

##### Dorteel 01/22/2020 08:23:55
Hi guys! I'm trying to set the built-in TurtleBot 3 Burger's linear velocity to match the real TurtleBot 3 Burger's maximum linear velocity of 0.22 m/s (as specified here: [http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/specifications/](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/specifications/)), but I run into a warning, saying that the maxVelocity is set to 2.84 rad/sec (which in this case with 0.033m wheel radius would be around 0.09 m/s) and I can't exceed that. Is there a way to change that maximum velocity?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/22/2020 07:03:56
Yes that may be an explanation, we have noticed such kind of performance difference across OS (in one way or the other) too. Make sure that your GPU drivers are up to date on Windows.

##### Luiz Felipe 01/22/2020 05:32:55
Hello. I am running webots on windows with a 1080Ti gpu and with a 1060Ti gpu. In both of them for my environment the speed is around 0.5x. When i run the same environment in linux with the 1080Ti I get around 0.9-1x speed. This problem is related with the nvidia drivers for windows?

##### Angerbot 01/21/2020 15:03:24
It is a ATI Radeon HD 5870 im sure - sounds right. I will give the above a go! thanks !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 15:01:53
`@Angerbot` you're welcome, happy to see you like it.

What is your GPU? Make sure that the drivers are up to date.

In the worse case you can disable some of the OpenGL feature: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl)

For example disabling the 'Ambient Occlusion' might help quite a lot on low-end GPU.

You might find other tips too here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance)

I've made a video that shows the behavior : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ex\_tqCoKFI&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ex_tqCoKFI&feature=youtu.be) One world works, one world doesn't. Both world have the same proto with the same controller, but in one, it's the children of a proto, and in the other the children of a robot


I've tried to replicate the bug with "default/box" protos, but I wasn't able to replicate it. It seems to not works when it's a proto which has another proto has a children


I tried your file and your world, it does work

##### Gautier A. 01/21/2020 13:25:53
The proto is a generic proto, with  just "rotation IS rotation" and "    field SFRotation rotation               0 1 0 0                   # Is `Transform.rotation`."


for the supervisor


Node * reaction = supervisor->getSelf();

  double rotation[4] = {0,0,0,0};

  double * tempo;    

  Field * rotationField = reaction->getField("rotation");



    tempo = (double *) rotationField->getSFRotation();

    rotation[0] = tempo[0];

Hi `@Gautier A.`, do you have a simple example / procedure to share?

##### Gautier A. 01/21/2020 13:16:09
What I mean by "It doesn't works" is that I have to save the simulation and reset it for the value to be actualized


I have a problem : I try to get the value of a field (the "rotation" field)  from a proto. It doesn't works when the node is a proto (but it does works when that proto is converted to base node).


Hello !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 13:07:45
`@aysegulucar` can you reproduce the same problem with the 'Reset Simulation' button ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#file-menu)) ?

Are you using the latest version of Webots (we fixed some issues with the reset in R2020a).

##### moustachemartin 01/21/2020 12:32:19
`@DrVoodoo`   Yes the boxes have physics nodes. I have added contact properties to each part. I have increased the torque of the motors. And still it won‚Äôt lift.

##### aysegulucar 01/21/2020 12:26:08
Hi DAvid , Thanks.  I did not undestand the sentence  Do you have one specific procedure to reproduce the issue?  I am using def myreset(self):

        supervisor = self.simulationReset() in my supervisor. I just used simulationReset instead of working one,  worldload reset. I  think, it has problem at multiple itarations, for example 25. I have added sleep but it has still problem

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/21/2020 12:11:19
`@moustachemartin` does the box have physics? Or is it immovable?

##### moustachemartin 01/21/2020 12:09:57
Hi all. I‚Äôm currently working on a university assignment. Building a robotic arm in webots. I have everything working. But my end effector won‚Äôt grip the box. The motors grab it. But it won‚Äôt pick it up. It just slides out. Can anyone help.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/21/2020 06:56:21
`@aysegulucar` it should work for all the joints/motors, I jsut tested and it seems to works fine for me with the op2. Do you have one specific procedure to reproduce the issue?

##### aysegulucar 01/20/2020 21:50:43
Hello, I think that simualtion reset does not work for op2 because just head is reseted but arms dont reset. Is it correct?

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/20/2020 21:46:44
@jc or you can get the current simulation time off the robot node

##### JC 01/20/2020 19:07:05
awesome , ill read through the documentation. Thanks for the help

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/20/2020 19:06:42
As long as you keep the timestep count yourself, yes

##### JC 01/20/2020 19:06:02
or something like that


ah i see , so it would allow me to reset the simulation after a set number of time steps?

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/20/2020 19:05:02
But you set supervisor to True on your robot and you get access to the god mode functions, including rest sim


Well, it's not a node.

but you can start it from the terminal from the webots folder


Using the tarball package the application is not really "installed" on the system, i.e. the `webots` command is not available from any terminal path


Hi `@John-ns` , you should type `./webots` to start the application

`@bsr.nur.bahadir` ok, this definitely means that you have one library installed on your computer that is causing conflicts with the jpeg library used by Webots, unfortunately it is very difficult for me to say where this library can be located.


`@Dorteel` good news !

##### Dorteel 01/20/2020 11:16:23
Yes `@David Mansolino` , exactly. But managed to find the problem, I changing the order I add the wheels solved the issue first the right then the left wheel instead of other way around.

Hi `@David Mansolino` , thanks for the quick reply. Using 2020a, and custom controller that was working on my model of TurtleBot3, but not on this one. I made sure to rename everything I use accordingly (LiDAR, wheels, robot)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/20/2020 10:40:26

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/20/2020 09:53:02
`@bsr.nur.bahadir` using the Nvidia GPU is indeed a better idea to run Webots ;-)

Please make sure:

  1. to update your GPU drivers.

  2. that your `PATH` environment variable is clean (it is for example possible that a conflicting version of the jpeg library is in your path).

##### bsr.nur.bahadir 01/20/2020 09:50:25
`@David Mansolino` I'm using lastest version of Webots on Windows. I actually don't know too much these things but when I run Webots with Nvidia's gpu it's having jpg issue but if I use Intel's this time program generally shuts down itself.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/20/2020 06:57:01
`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` you can find the exact same worlds in Webots in 'projects/samples/robotbenchmark': [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/samples/robotbenchmark)

Hello! Is there a way to get the terrain from the bb-8 example in [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/) to run locally? The example in the webots installation has a perlin noise terrain.

##### bsr.nur.bahadir 01/18/2020 13:32:00

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/18/2020 11:07:38
No, there is no such a thing in Webots. You can however adjust the friction parameters to make the contact properties as close as possible as if it was sand, but I am not sure how realistic that could be.

Thank you very much for the quick response, I will try to implement that now

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 15:57:48
But of course other solutions exist (but this is probably the simplest one).


Hi e-puck, you can use amitter-receiver devices for example to broadcast a message when the epuck finish its task, when all the e-pucks are broadcasting it means they have all finished.

##### e-puck 01/17/2020 15:52:57
Hello, I'm currently working with e-pucks in Webots. I'm struggling with synchronizing the e-pucks (they should wait for all pucks to finish moving before beginning a new cycle (cycle is look-compute-move)). I'm currently doing this by allocating e-pucks a max number of timesteps, when e-pucks finish before the max number of timesteps, they wait. This methods works but causes very very long simulations. Would anyone know of a better solution?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 14:12:29
Hello `@sunnyjerai` , as any other sensors you have to activate it, then you can use the `getRollPitchYaw` fucntion which will return you an array with three components representing (in this order) the roll, the pitch and the yaw.

`@David Mansolino` Hi David, thanks very much for your detailed response. Looking forward to creating!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 13:33:55
We strongly recommend to use the Webots tutorial to get familiar with Webots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


There is no interface for arduino but as arduino support C language and Webots too it should be quite simple to go from one to the other.


Yes of course you can use the position-sensor device to read a joint angle and then use the motor API to control the joint


From fusion 360 you should export your model into VRML format, this format can then be imported into Webots.


Hi `@Angerbot` You can download Webots from here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/R2020a-rev1)

##### Angerbot 01/17/2020 13:19:52
Appreciate!


Hi `@michou214` Im not yet able to download the software to use. Does Webots allow import of third-party platforms such as Fusion 360? Is it also possible to input code that will, for instance simulate readings from an optical encoder then potentially execute new joint-movement from input corrections?What is the compatibility with arduino and possibility to form movement and automatically generate code for arduino IDE?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/17/2020 07:06:54
`@sujit` if you want Cyberbotics provide professional consulting and can create the model for you.


`@sujit`, welcome to Webots!

Unfortunately we don't have a spot mini model yet, but you can create one yourself, here is a tutorial for creating a simple robot model: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)

And then to create a PROTO from it: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)


`@bsr.nur.bahadir`, do you experience this with one specific simulation? Or when adding one specific object? On which OS are you and are you using the latest version of Webots?

In any case, make sure that your GPU drivers are up to date.

The Compass is very basic, it only indicates the direction of the WorldInfo.northDirection vector. A white noise can be added using the lookupTable. Compass doesn't deal with anything else, such as electromagnetic field, etc.

So technically possible but definitely not worth the hassle. Thanks for the help, I'll stick with the rename

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:48:19
You're welcome


Unfortunately that's not so simple, Node arguments are not simply translated into strings but into a dictionnary (that you have to parse if you want to use it: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#programming-facts](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#programming-facts))

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:46:32
Ok, thanks


In effect something like 
```extensionSlot [ 
  %{= fields.extensionSlot.value }%
```

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:44:41
Yes, simply renaming it in your BaseChassis.proto should fix the problem. You can do this with lua too indeed, but that's more complicated

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:43:47
Ok, so I have got to rename it? I have also been trying to use the lua template syntax to insert the contents of the field into the existing extensionSlot definition but my lua is non-existant

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:42:14
Ok yes I forgot this rule, in that case you simply have to use another name for your field in BaseChassis.proto, such as:

```
...
    extensionSlot [
      Group {
        children IS baseChassisExtension
      }
      other nodes...
    ]
...
```

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:40:40
specifically "error: Derived and base PROTO can use the same parameter name only if it is linked directly, like 'extensionSlot IS extensionSlot'."


but if I try that approach is get an error


`@David Mansolino` you've definitely understood that I'm trying to achieve

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:38:54
Ok, the solution is quite simple, if you want to extend and not override you have to create something like this in BaseChassis.proto:

```
...
    extensionSlot [
      Group {
        children IS extensionSlot
      }
      other nodes...
    ]
```

Does this answer your question (I am not 100% sure to understand the problem)?

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:36:02
but I can't append the contents of that to extensionSlot of the Car, all I can do is override it


I can add an extensionSlot field to ACar (field MFNode     extensionSlot   [])


Hi `@David Mansolino`


Let's call this new proto ACar

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 15:34:31
Hi `@DrVoodoo`

##### DrVoodoo [Moderator] 01/15/2020 15:33:12
So I've another proto that defines a BaseChassis and then I want to be able to add to the extensionSlot of the Car


We got various possible configurations of sensors that can be stuck on this base chassis (let's call it BaseChassis.proto)


*are declared


Is anyone able to help with a question regarding proto files? I've got a proto defines a Car and then additional aspects of the design as declared within the extensionSlot (body shell geometry etc)

Supervisor is a super-class of Robot and hence expose all the Robot API + the Supervisor API.

Ah, thanks! I'll take a look, much appreciated.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 14:34:06
(see the driver.py example in Webots/projects/languages/python/controller/driver/driver.py)


Then you should derivate your controller class from Supervisor instead of deriving it from Robot.

##### LaCava 01/15/2020 14:32:33

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 14:32:30
Which programming language do you use?

##### LaCava 01/15/2020 14:31:26
Hi -- apologies for this incredibly simple question (\_very\_ new to Webots), but when a Robot has its Supervisor attribute set to TRUE, how are those functions actually invoked (say, within a controller)?



After reading the docs, I was under the impression that I could call them as if they were Robot functions inside my controller, but this doesn't appear to be the case, unless I've gone off the rails in my understanding/setup.



The controller itself is simple, I've got a robot class containing a few basic initialization functions, and a run function that accepts keyboard input to change LED colors (advanced robotics, I know). My goal was to map some supervisor functions to keypresses as well, just to see it 'working' - but this is met with AttributeErrors, since the class doesn't actually \_have\_ those functions.



Outwith the class, the robot is instantiated and its run() function invoked. Like I said, it's quite barebones.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/15/2020 11:53:38
`@sajid` why would you need to add the supervisor specifically to the wheel ? Can't you just pu tthe supervisor at the root of the tree and get the wheel from the supervisor?

You can either transform the car itself in a supervisor (by setting the `supervisor` to true) either add an independant supervisor that will communicate with your vehicle using emitter-receiver.

If you are interested Cyberbotics provide professionnal consulting and can send you an offer for developing this for you.


`@User21`, ok then you are in a very similar setup to the known working one, that's good. When the controller crashes, do you have any stack displayed?

`@Lifebinder (tsampazk)` the getVelocity function returns the absolute velocity (thank you for pointing this out, we will make this clearer in the doc), if you want to get relative velocities you simply have to get the velocity of the other solid too and compute the difference.


`@PA` , I am sorry but this chat is in english only.


`@User21` hi, with which robot are you using MoveIt and with ROS1 or ROS2 ? And which controller are you using (the default ros controller?)? I don't know the MoveGroup Commander but we have successfully used MoveIt in RViz to control the UR5e robot in Webots.

##### User21 01/14/2020 17:08:58

Ok, that's nice.  Thanks `@Fabien Rohrer`

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:44:43
It is done in the tower\_of\_hanoi.wbt sample:


> YouBot.bodySlot [ Kinect {}]


Yes, you can add the Kinect into the youBot slots.


Yes, the arm is controlled by a sequence of predefined poses, except for the final approach where IK is used to move the arm down perfectly vertically. A local GPS (and Compass if I remember well) is used to move the robot at the correct location.

##### nap 01/14/2020 14:42:56
Can the Youbot proto accept a Kinect?


Ok, that's fine.  I suppose it's just a sequence of poses

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:41:48
It is only enabled.


To be honest, the Kinect is not used in the tower of hanoi demo üôÇ


No, but an interface with the Kinect can be directly done in the controller.

##### nap 01/14/2020 14:40:45
Cool.  Does that library include facilities for a Kinect?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:39:29
In Webots, the youbot controllers are using this library which offers helper functions to control the arm and the base. (basic IK, etc.)


.. and the youbot library: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot\_control](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/projects/robots/kuka/youbot/libraries/youbot_control)

According to the documentation, there is a world for the KUKA robot called `tower_of_hanoi.wbt`.  However, when I looked in the folder where it's supposed to be at, only the other two example worlds were there.  Can this, including the controller, be downloaded from somewhere?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/14/2020 14:24:22
Especially the: wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_set\_mode() [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_set\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_simulation_set_mode)


`@W.El-Badry`  This is certainly possible using the Supervisor API:

##### W.El-Badry 01/14/2020 14:19:39
Is there any step by step for doing a "step simulation" using Python? i.e. :

1. Send a command like speed and step.

2. Webots do a step (10 ms).

3. Sends back acknowledgment for step completion and wait for next step command.

##### sajid 01/14/2020 13:16:51
`@David Mansolino` Thanks David. I will try to reuse the code. However, this is not what we are looking for though. It would be great if we could find the displacement of the car from the centre of lane at any given point. For that, we were looking into using a supervisor as you also suggested. We are encountering few modelling challenges here. 

Is it possible to add a supervisor to the wheel of the car?

How to run the supervisor along with the car driver?

It would be great if you could help us with these challenges.



Thanks again for your suggestions in the right direction.

Best,Sajid

`@siti_raehan` you can either use an inertial unit device to retrieve direction the orientation of the robot or if you use the initial orientation you can use odometry to update the orientation at each step.

##### sunnyjerai 01/13/2020 15:12:51
Instead of using DEF string , I just copied the shape geometry from all those transforms. It worked. I later exported it as a proto node.


Thank you `@David Mansolino`

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/13/2020 07:09:19
`@sajid`, this is not a trivial task but you can use a Supervisor to parse the world and get the trajectory of the road. You might be interessted by this script that parses a webots world file to extract the position of the roads: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/resources/sumo\_exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/resources/sumo_exporter)


`@sunnyjerai` the DEF should be defined inside the PROTO file, is it the case ?


`@Dr. Sudip Chakraborty` not for robotic arm, but there is a step by step tutorial for a wheeled robot: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)

Creatign a robotic arm is very similar (excepte that your joint should be serial).


`@Fandykun` yes of course, Webots can easily simulate many robots (this will of course have an impact on the simulation speed, but if your computer is powerful enough this shouldn't be a problem).

I think i might be getting the error since the body borrows its definition from a different node


The definition of bounding objects were taken from transforms

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/11/2020 10:47:46
For hounding objects I think you can chwck the tutorials as well


Also robot is used twice names should be unique


It says you haven't defined bounding object in each solid you can define that

##### sunnyjerai 01/11/2020 10:44:20
Hello everyone, I imported a VRML file of my robot chassis which appeared as multiple transforms. I then proceeded to make a robot node in the scene tree and used the DEF strings from all those transforms to define the body of the robot. I wanted to make this robot as a proto node for the project so I followed the steps in tutorial 7.  After that, the Robot did appear in proto nodes, however the body is missing and I got the error as shown in the picture. The 2 wheels and distance sensors appeared since they were defined separately.

Hi `@Fandykun` you can use a spherical camera to simulate an omni-vision camera, see an example distributed within Webots here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#spherical\_camera-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#spherical_camera-wbt)

you should use `robot.getLightSensor('ds_left')`

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:31:44
okay, understood

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 10:31:28
Ok. Your sensor is a LightSensor and not a DistanceSensor.

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:31:23

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 10:29:22
Note that from a robot controller you can get only a device defined inside the Robot model running the controller and you cannot access devices of other robots. Not sure if this is the case in your simulation.


I suspect there is some issue with the names, because the devices are not found.

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:26:04
They are correct


Yes , that's first thing I checked

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 10:23:32
`@sunnyjerai` did you double checked if the device names defined in the DistanceSensor.name field of your robot are  "ds\_left" and "ds\_right"?

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 10:15:04
Hi `@David Mansolino` , I added print(ds) as you suggested and this is the result.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/09/2020 09:37:26
However, I think this is a complex solution: from my experiment, having a single, well structured and single-threaded controller is always simpler to implement and more robust.


You have to implement a way to dialog between them (for example using an Emitter/Receiver)


A Robot can contain other Robot instances with their own controllers.


Webots can indeed handle this.


Hi,

##### ClBaze 01/09/2020 09:34:07
Hi guys, I'd like to simulate an attitude and orbit control system.

The simulated spacecraft would have 4 gyros, 3 star trackers, 6 reaction wheels and 16 thrusters.

I want to implement custom noise models for each sensor and actuator.

My first idea was to do this in the webots controller of the robot node containing all these components (the spacecraft).

But as these devices work at different frequencies, I think it's not the best idea.

What do you think if I put each device in a robot node with its own controller, and all these robot nodes in another robot node (the spacecraft).

I mean it makes a lot of executables (webots controllers), do you think Webots could handle it ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/09/2020 08:42:41
Hi `@sunnyjerai`, your code seems correct, can you add a print(ds) right after the ds.append ?

##### sunnyjerai 01/09/2020 08:21:16
Hello, I was working with a self made robot, the controller code in almost the same as in Tutorial 6. However, I keep getting this error on line 9 of the controller. Can anyone tell me why this error occurs and what might be the possible solution to it.

`@User21` unfortunately not directly, however, you can export the world in VRML format from Webots: File => Export VRML97...

Then you can use a software (e.g. Blender) to convert VRML to any other format (such as Collada).


`@azpi` if you use the default Webots Makefile you don't need to care about this.

But in any case these files are located in WEBOTS\_HOME/include/controller/c (see: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/include/controller/c/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/master/include/controller/c/webots) )


`@Dr. Sudip Chakraborty`, no idea, you should probably check in the doc: [https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genindex.html](https://ikpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genindex.html)

Once this is done, you could modify all the nodes defining the robot, including the gripper.


you can convert the youBot PROTO node to base node, by rightclicking on it in the scene tree, and select "Convert to Base node."


yes, it's possible.

Hey :)

is it possible to change the kuka youbot gripper?

OK also will these above steps be similar

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 13:09:14
with the syncronized setup, you should need to call the step for each robot, otherwise the simulation will block.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 12:56:34
Will the time updated in bith cases be the same or not if not which one is the correct simulation time


So my question is are these two cases equivalent in Webots and what about the time gaurantees


In a multi robot scenario in syncronized setup.

We can do two things.

1. Wait for all robots cmd vel, when everything is available, than call one robot/time\_step service to update the simulation. 

1.1.Is it ok to call just one service robot/time\_step for update of all of the robots or we have to call service for every single robot.

2. Not waiting for all robots data contrary to above approach, for every robot whenever the data is available call its own service to uodate the simulation. 

2.1. In this case multiple robots will update time is this OK

##### sunnyjerai 01/08/2020 12:40:30
Understood, Thanks a lot for the help üòÑ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 01/08/2020 12:39:35
You could choose one of them, or add directly a PBRAppearance node, and play with its parameters.


Webots comes with an appearance set: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/appearances](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/appearances)


You just need to remove the node in the RectangleArena.floorAppearance, and add another appearance instead.


You selected the correct field üôÇ

I just commented this service call part in my code and the robots are still moving

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 10:53:55
Yes, if each robot is using it's own ros controller and has the `--synchronize` argument it will wait for each robot to call the service.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 10:53:27
Or should I wait for all robots to get the data and than call this service once


Will this be the same for multiple robots running in different threads

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 10:48:14
The simulation will not run as long as you don't call the step service and you use the `--synchronize` argument.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 10:47:09
What I want to is until I get some data the robot should stop


If I don't call the /robot/time\_step service the robot should not move right?


Just a question for the ros service


OK I'll try that

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 09:40:46
`@jyuan` you can import your model in Webots saving it in VRML format (from the File menu select "Import VRML97").

Another option is to import your model in Blender and then user this Blender plugin to import in in Webots:

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/08/2020 09:29:04
Not really, is one of your robots kind of stuck or having many collision? You might want to check the contact points to make sure there is not an 'explosion' of th enumber of contact points. This is just an idea but might not be the cause.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/08/2020 09:27:47
Guys any thoughts I'm still having the problem


Hello,

I am using Webots with ros to simualte warehouse environments and forklifts. I am using Webots in asynchronous mode and using Webots simulation time as reference. 

Currently I am validating the simulation with our real experimental data from the warehouse. I am running the simulation in Fast mode.  initially the simulation starts with 18 to 20x speed and the robot runs blvery fast but its OK because it is taking round trip on average in 8.5 minutes which is true in real as well. 

But after 18 or 20 hours the robots gets too slow, ros is running fine no error at ros side I can see the commands published, no error in Webots. Data is also being exchanged as expected. None of the computational resources exhausted.

`@yash` once imported you may want to remove usless small shapes (such as screws, etc.) then you can group your shapes together using the Group node.

You might also merge your shapes directly in Solidworks before exporting your model.

Importing the CAD file from Solidworks has resulted into so many tranforms i.e one tranform corresponds to one shape .

I have trouble pls help me.  I am moving my arm using ikpy from my c# application over socket. in webots end  tcp server is running for receiving the command. after creating the server object webots not responding . server running in separate thread. what is the issue?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 10:47:36
I am not sure, you should probably directly ask the developers of the libraries.

But since it is the library behind moveit used by ROS it is probably quite safe.

##### Dr. Sudip Chakraborty 01/07/2020 10:46:00
can i use ikpy for industrial use?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 10:44:01
Hi `@Dr. Sudip Chakraborty`, we do not provide such example (we do provide a Python example) but you can fore sure find some libraries on internet that does this, e.g. [http://openrave.org/docs/0.8.2/openravepy/ikfast/](http://openrave.org/docs/0.8.2/openravepy/ikfast/)

##### Dr. Sudip Chakraborty 01/07/2020 10:41:25
is there any cpp ik pki for 6df arm?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 07:37:40
`@lunarpulse`, we have a documentation about using numerical optimization with Webots that might be of interest for you: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-numerical-optimization-methods)


> I didnt install it, so i think this is the porblem i thought it is automatically installed wth Webots

`@User21`, no it is not installed automatically with our ROS1 interface (it is with our ROS2 package).

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/07/2020 07:28:38
`@User21` you should probably check where does your ROS\_LOG\_DIR variable point to and make sure that it exists and that is writable


About external controller I would suggest you to check the documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)

After setting the required environmental variables it should work the same as in Webots


`@Nocturnal Warfare` you could check the `altino.wbt` simulation (in `projects/robots/saeon/worlds` folder): in this Python controller after pressing M to enable the manual control, the wheeled robot is controlled using the arrows keys.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 01/07/2020 02:29:53
are there any tutorials involving python with keyboard control of a robot, like WASD control of a wheeled robot. I specifically would need it through an external controller but that is a problem for another day.

##### lunarpulse 01/06/2020 23:32:26
Hi everyone,

Have you done use Webot as the basis of Reinforcement Learning? I saw some ROS developers using Gazebo to train robotic arms. I want to hear experienced people's opinion.

##### User21 01/06/2020 18:56:54
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` 

it woked but if i want to start the simulation i get the error message: WARNING: cannot create log directory [ros\_python\_log]. Please set ROS\_LOG\_DIR to a writable location.


`@Stefania Pedrazzi` 

First of all thank you for your fast response.

I didnt install it, so i think this is the porblem i thought it is automatically installed wth Webots

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 17:08:24
Hi `@User21`,

you can use any ros package to connect with the Webots ROS interface.

About using MoveIT with other robots you should probably refer to the MoveIT documentation, but a priori I think that yes you can do it after configuring it.

 Do you have the `universal_robots` package installed?


ok, so then if your controller is also simple and you are available to send it to us (for example using Gist) we will look at it. But it should work out of the box on a single machine, otherwise it would be difficult to reproduce the issue.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/06/2020 16:56:19
I am intended to ise it for multiple robots may be 10 or 20 in that case I can say the world would be complex but not in the case now I think so


It is just one robot in Webots and nothing else at all


This is the simplest I can run now


Well just to clarify I am using Supervisor API but not for robot motion control.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 16:52:59
The fact that the resources where not exhausted let me think that it could be an internal problem. But if you are not deleting/creating nodes and you are not using the Supervisor API (that could be affected by the changes in the scene tree) the problem is not where I though it could be.

If could try to simplify your simulation as much as possible so that it still reproduces the issue but in a simple example (maybe running a simple controller on one machine) we will take a look at it to try to understand what is the problem.

##### User21 01/06/2020 16:51:32
Hi,

I am new to Webots and i want to use MoveIT with the UR5e.

I have several questions:

1.If i try to launch MOVEIT! like in the documentation written i always get this error message:



Resource not found: ur\_e\_description

ROS path [0]=/opt/ros/melodic/share/ros

ROS path [1]=/home/arches/catkin\_ws/src

ROS path [2]=/opt/ros/melodic/share

The traceback for the exception was written to the log file

(I just copied the file ur\_e\_webots in my catkin workspace)

Is it possible to use MoveIT with other Manipulators like the KUKA YouBot?

Is it possible to use the ros Package navigation?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/06/2020 16:46:13
One is running hustvWebots and another just robot softwar


Non of the resources are exhasuted, also I am using to PCs directly connected via lan so I think no lag in the communication as well.


Hello,

I am using motor control to steer the robot not suoervisor api, not deleting any node from the scene tree,  memory consumption is same as at the start.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 16:43:11
`@Tahir` it could be that there are some internal data that is not managed efficiently and will slow down the simulation. But it is difficult to tell without looking in details at your simulation. 

Are you using the Supervisor API for updating the robot position?

Are you creating/deleting many nodes?

Did you notice if the memory usage continuously increase while running the simulation?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 01/06/2020 13:41:49
This cloud warning is fine, but here in the screenshot the velocity amd angles are continously sent but robots position updates too slowly

I really am not getting what could be the problem


Due to this slow motion of tue robot now round trip time goes to 20 30 minutes.


Hello,

I am using Webots with ros to simualte warehouse environments and forklifts. I am using Webots in asynchronous mode and using Webots simulation time as reference. 

Currently I am validating the simulation with our real experimental data from the warehouse. I am running the simulation in Fast mode.  initially the simulation starts with 18 to 20x speed and the robot runs blvery fast but its OK because it is taking round trip on average in 8.5 minutes which is true in real as well. 

But after 18 or 20 hours the robots gets too slow, ros is running fine no error at ros side I can see the commands published, no error in Webots. Data is also being exchanged as expected. None of the computational resources exhausted.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/06/2020 07:56:44
`@musabcoskun`, the problem should now be fixed (if it is not the case, please clear the cache of your browser).


`@yash`, you have to add the motors and sensors in Webots directly after importing your CAD model, you should probably have a look at this tutorial explaining how to create your own robot model: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot)


`@musabcoskun`, ok thank yo ufor the confirmation, I have logged this in our bug tracker and we will fix this soon: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1235](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1235)


`@yunus`, you are in the right direction, using a sliderjoint ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/sliderjoint](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/sliderjoint)) and setting appropriate jointparameters ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparameters)) is indeed the way to go.

Here are the steps:

  - Add a Solid node (which a bounding object but no physics) this is your wall (it is static since there is no physics).

  - In the children field of the Solid add a SliderJoint.

  - In the `jointParamerters` field of the SliderJoint add a JointParameters node.

  - In the `endPoint` field of the SliderJoint add a Solid node (which is your moving mass with physics).

##### yash 01/05/2020 13:09:44
So that I can make the controller accordingly.


I have imported my solidworks model into webots. How do we define the motors and sensors on the CAD model .?

Hello. We want to use Webots to implement a simple physical model: one solid mass joined by a spring to a stationary mass (to a wall for example). We want the spring to oscillate continuously as it would be in real life. We came across this description: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparametersfound](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/jointparametersfound), we want to implement that figure "Mechanical Diagram of a Slider Joint" at the end of that webpage.



We found SliderJoint.wrl in the ..resources/nodes folder of Webots, but we couldn't import it in Webots, and there is no node in Webots that accomplish that spring motion.



Can you please give us a lead on how to proceed? Thank you so much

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 09:52:11
Please make sure when you export from SolidWorks that you select VRML97 and not another version of VRML.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 09:41:08
What are exactly the error you get?

It might be normal that you get some errors since Webots doesn't implements all the fields of VRML (such as colorPerVertex for example), but this shouldn't prevent the shape to be functionnal.

##### yash 01/03/2020 09:39:17

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 01/03/2020 07:47:52
`@nap`, are you trying to launch your controller yourself as an 'extern' controller?


`@Shanks`, yes, it is highly recommended to start with the tutorials: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


`@SomeOne`, yes you can use Blender to create your robot model and then export it to PROTO using our Blender-to-Webots converter: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)


`@swebdev`, if it is the root node you can simply add a bounding object without any Physics node. Otherwise you can use a SolidReference and set it's 'solidName' field to '<static environment>' ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference))


`@Tahir`, there are many ways to increase the lightning of your scene, have you tried increasing the value of the Background.luminosity field for example?


`@„ÄéDEM√é„ÄèGhozt (Redsign)` and `@sugus105`, you can export your robot in VRML from SolidWorks and then import this VRML file in Webots directly (not that this will import only the shapes, you will then have to add solids, bounding objects, physics, sensors, etc.). Or import from SolidWorks to Blender and then Blender to Webots, here is an example with Catia (Solidworks works similarly): [https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4](https://youtu.be/L0FVsFD2rS4)


`@BoBo73` Unfortunately the motion editor is not available in the latest version of Webots anymore, instead you should use directly motor control: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions)


`@Shanaka` instead of using motion file you should control directly the motor individually  (in speed, position or torque/force) using the motor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions)

You can easily get the name of the individual motors by double-clicking on the robot to open the robot-window.

IF you didn't already did, I strongly recommend to follow our tutorial (which explains how to control the motors individually): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

%end


currently working as a research engineer in the department of electrical and electronic engineering, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. These days, I engaged to design simulation using PUMA 560 robot manipulator in WEBOT and note that I'm very new to webot. 



I modified the end-tool of the manipulator by replacing the Pioneer gripper



I  control this entire manipulator (with new gripper) by modifying puma560.motion file and puma560.c file. 



But I need to add dynamics and individual joint controllers to this simulation with the idea of implementation in real world. So i check puma560.c file and there I found  functions called 



wbu\_motion\_new("puma560\_1.motion");

wbu\_motion\_play(motion);

but I was not able to find the definition of these functions anywhere. ( I checked motion.h Motion.hpp Motion.cpp files.) Although I can find the function definitions inside the above-mentioned files, still I was not able to find function definitions and how the given angles fed to motors in the manipulator by wbu\_motion\_play() function. 



The final target is to implement the controller in the real world using Raspberry pi or FPGA microcontrollers. So by using wbu\_motion\_play() functions how can I do it? Where can I find the function description? If this method is impossible, it will be great if you can give guidance to make it a success. 



your response will be highly appreciated !!

##### HBK 12/31/2019 21:02:32
`@Tahir` Thank you very much these were really useful insights.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/31/2019 20:58:36
so I would say it depends upon your requirements so just try it


sorry I forgot to mention in my case the local planner takes some time so I to synchronize or in other words to wait for ros to plan everything I did that


like here on this link you can see asynchronous waits for webots\_robot\_step to execute


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#synchronous-versus-asynchronous-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#synchronous-versus-asynchronous-controllers)

##### HBK 12/31/2019 20:55:15
As you are emphasizing more on asynchronous mode can I know the trade offs of using this mode.(Mostly cons over synchronous mode)

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/31/2019 11:30:32
I will suggest spending a little more time on step one and two and making sure that everything is 101% working as expected becase if there is a problem at this point this might give you hard time and you might see random behaviour


5. I will again highly suggest using asynchronous mode with this you can also run the headless mode and the robot will for sure wait for the commads and hopefully there will be no problem but I am not expert may be there might somone else shed light on this


1. you can start import your robot model in Webots. You can use urdf2webots or some other plugins available on Webots gihub. The model produced will be a little crude. So you can start organizing the stuff e.g. naming sensors and actuators, setting up the fields with resepctive bounding objects etc and atlast you can make a proto if you want. There are alot of example protos you can just change them to base node and see the hieracrhy there is also DJI drone in webots you can check that as well. 



2. After that I will say check the robots maneuverabilty that it moves in the correct direction and orientation for example teleopate on a line and a circle. 



3. Next is just write a small script which at the start enables webots devices. 



4. Webots is left handed system whereas ROS is right handed. This was another problem which I faced so there was two options one to write a transformation which actually does the correct mappings or another to change webots simulation to right handed, so I have gone for the second I changedevery nodes perspective which is now perfectly fine this will have some graphics issues but thats dependant on your need what do you want.

I have multi-drone system with 4 drones working in an environment. Where I am applying Travelling salesmen Problem (K-TSP) to solve the issue.

So In gazebo sometimes drones fell down

In Gazebo


Brief of my project details:


I am well verse with ROS and gazebo. What will be best way to start shifting my project in webots `@Tahir`

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/30/2019 18:39:39
Well I have 25 I will suggest use asynchronous mode that will not create much load and will update every robot individually, initially I was using synchronous so robots sometimes got out of the planned path. Also in my case visuals are not important I have everything in rviz. So previously when I run without graphics it didn't worked at all because ros and webots frequencies were different so it didn't made sense, now in asynchronous if I run without graphics robots stays on path.

Also I connected two pcs directly with lan, one running just webots and another just ros, so in this way its working well for me.

##### HBK 12/30/2019 18:28:39
`@Tahir` Great !!!  Thank you very much.  I am planning to work with 10 robots wont creating multiple instances make process slow ?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/30/2019 08:32:11
Webots ROS handling is also good everything is in form of services which might make life easier at some points


Well I am using Webots for multi agents planning. I would say it's great. I haven't worked with Gazebo quite much, but we already had simulation for single robot in Gazebo(which I didn't worked on, my supervisor did, he said that it might not work for multiple robots in our scenario we can just try) so I moved on to Webots. It didn't gave me much hard time as compared to other ones. I imported my custom robot. Wrote interfaces for Webots services and our custom software. Than just created multiple instances of robots in Webots, run multiple software instances and eveything worked.

##### HBK 12/30/2019 08:11:51
Is Webots a good simulator for Multi-agent planning ? It will be a great help if I get a brief comparison of gazebo and Webots for ROS integration.

##### swebdev 12/28/2019 23:40:36
`@Shanks` You could try to get your hands dirty on [http://robotbenchmark.net/](http://robotbenchmark.net/) which is fun.

As you start going with it, the further next step will be to stick to the rest of the documentation.

##### nap 12/28/2019 04:10:05
`@David Mansolino` :  I've found that under MacOS, I have the same problem with `libController.dylib`.  The runtime error is:



`dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/lib/libController.dylib

  Referenced from: /Users/user/src/webots/projects/controllers/ePuckIface/./build.host/ePuckIface

  Reason: image not found`



And as before, setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` makes the problem go away.


`@David Mansolino` :  I made a little progress.  Setting the link command to:

`g++ -Wl,-rpath-link,"/usr/local/webots/lib/webots/",-rpath-link,"/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/" -Wl,-R "/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/" -s -o build/release/ePuckMeander build/release/ePuck.o build/release/ePuckMeanderBhvr.o build/release/ePuckContainer.o -lm -L"/usr/local/webots/lib/controller" -lController -lCppController`



Fixed the `libCppController.so` runtime error, but now it's complaining about libController.so.  

I would have thought that given the two are in the same folder specified by `-rpath-link` this would be fixed.  However, since I'm not actually building `libCppController.so`, it may be the reason.



By setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/webots/lib/controller/` fixed the problem, but I would consider this a bandaid solution.


`@David Mansolino` : Well, that almost worked.  It generated a binary, but upon running it, it issued an error stating it could not find  `libCppController.so`.  This is confirmed by using `ldd` on my controller.


`@David Mansolino` :Problem solved.  I needed to add a line in my Makefile with the following: `LFLAGS=-Wl,-rpath-link,/usr/local/webots/lib/webots` parameters, and it's worked.

I jave changed the webots coordinate system from LHS to RHS, to get everyhing compatible with ROS. Initially I had problems with the light source so I changed to Point light and it worked fine for a smaller scenario. Now I am having a bigger scenario around 300x300 meters and point light does not seems to be a feasible option . As to get a better overview after increasing its intensity I can not monitor it as after sonetime I get headache because of too much brightness. Any alernative or suggestions to change will highly be appreciated

the perfect value can be found from the API or is stored in the .wbt file using a double precision.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 14:45:08
You are completely right, the makefile.include assumes that you are using the Webots project standard file hierarchy: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project)

##### nap 12/13/2019 14:42:22
`@David Mansolino` : I figured it out.

`Makefile.include` relies on a hierarchy of folders for various things;

1. The name of the controller is assigned from the name of the containing folder, 

2, If there is a folder named 'controllers' in the branch (presumably one level above), then the code is compiled to an executable, otherwise a shared library, and

3. Maybe other things which I haven't worked out yet.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 14:16:48
`@nap`, yes if you do not specify any path, make is executing the Makefile in the current folder


Yes, it should be included in this one: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)

##### nap 12/13/2019 14:01:36
`@David Mansolino` : I'm experiencing a strange problem here.  In some folders, `make` ends up generating a dylib (shared library) instead of an executable. Does `make` have a default location where it checks for Makefiles?  I thought it was just the local directory or if specified, at a given path.

Very good news, it now makes much more sense.



>  I have to put a torque inverse to the first one on the solid node of the base



Yes, that's probabyl the best solution.



> I understand now why it had this kind of behavior for the first video, I assume it was because after controlling the motor directly in torque, the "PID" switch off so the motor no longer try to stay in position "0" ?



If you want to keep the motor, to disable it you can probably call the `wb_motor_set_available_torque` with a zero torque ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions))

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:59:46
(I understand now why it had this kind of behavior for the first video, I assume it was because after controlling the motor directly in torque, the "PID" switch off so the motor no longer try to stay in position "0" ?)


I assume that, than, to completly simulate the "expected behavior" (by that, I mean, the reaction of torque in the opposite sense on the base), I have to put a torque inverse to the first one on the solid node of the base ?


You were right


Without motor, it has this kind of behavior


[https://youtu.be/8SqgdZr4MTQ](https://youtu.be/8SqgdZr4MTQ)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:53:40
Ok, then this is probably the cause of the issue, the motor is applying some torque to make sure the joint remains at the 0 position. Can you try the same without the motor ?

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:52:59
Do you want me to send my world and controller ?


Yes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:52:35
Just to make sure, you have a motor in the joint lonking the two solid ?

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:52:31

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:51:53
Ok, this is kind of reassuring at least the behavior is the same in both cases.

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:50:10
The two solid are considered "one" even though there is an hinge joint between them


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiH2hsKYLzc&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiH2hsKYLzc&feature=youtu.be)


Yes, of course

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/13/2019 09:37:22
Can you reproduce similar behavior simply by adding torque/force manually?

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-3d-window#applying-a-force-to-a-solid-object-with-physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-3d-window#applying-a-force-to-a-solid-object-with-physics)

##### Gautier A. 12/13/2019 09:28:15
Here is the behavior when a torque is applied on endsolid through a supervisor at the beginning of simulation (so without any linear velocity at the beginning): [https://youtu.be/nn7nhfxPxrQ](https://youtu.be/nn7nhfxPxrQ)


Did I do something wrong ? Do I need to apply a torque of the same intensity but in the other sense to simulate the "normal behavior" of mecanics ?


I have made a video to show you: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF0xkMFGZTQ&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF0xkMFGZTQ&feature=youtu.be)



Basically, I test a motor on a hinge joint in zero gravity and observe how the two solid react.

 - When a torque is applied to the joint through a motor (first mode, "motor mode"), the two solid react correctly according to their own mass and inertial matrix

 - When a torque is applied through a supervisor on the endsolid, we have two kind of different behavior depending on the initial condition:

           - If there was no initial linear velocity, the two solid rotate in the same sense, even though there is a joint between them (this behavior is not shown in the video above, I'm gonna link you another video right after)

           - If there was an initial linear velocity, only the endpoint solid spin


I'm experimenting with the new functions of the supervisor and I don't really understand how they behave


Thank you ! `@David Mansolino`

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:14:11
just add it after metalness?


This is what I have atm:



  floorAppearance PBRAppearance {

    baseColorMap ImageTexture {

      url [

        "textures/Floor\_10px\_small\_Inter\_center\_boarder\_infra-red31\_1024.png"

      ]

    }

    roughness 1

    metalness 0

  }

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:13:32
then the node in basColorMap you should see a 'filtering' field

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:13:16
yes I did

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:12:50
you did add a texure using the basColorMap field rights ?

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:12:20
Where does 'baseColorMap.filtering 0' go?  In the same PBR stanza?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:11:54
Let me know if that helps


Ok,, in that case you probably want:

  - metalness 0

  - roughness 1

  - baseColorMap.filtering 0



Make also sur to set in the preference OpenGL.Texture Quality to high

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:11:25
lol, so hard to express what I want, now that I'm trying to find the right words.


(And for the floor to look sharp.)


(With sharp edges between each.)


No aliasing, no merging.  I would like maximum contrast between the floor, lines, and intersection marker.


no, not a mirror.  My texture has a (almost) black floor (it's actually a shade of really dark red), with bright white lines that intersect in a grid.  At each intersection I have a cyan square which lets the robot know when it's in the right position in the intersection so it can make aligned turns.

##### Hayden Woodger 12/12/2019 14:07:24
Sounds like he wants the floor to be HD

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:05:36
I am not sure to understand exactly what you want to achieve, do you want the floor to belike a mirror ?

##### nap 12/12/2019 14:04:29
Anyone know what settings would help?


I have a question about PBRAppearance settings.  I would like to get a really sharp rendering of my floor texture (png).  Roughness 1 and metalness 1  (or both on zero) just don't cut it.  Either the line is dim and diffused, or it's just out of focus.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 14:02:10

`@David Mansolino` :  Thanks for the link to the E-Puck demo.  It helped me a lot!


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Hi!  I just got my controller working. üôÇ  But I need to tweak some control coefficients as well as the floor rendering to make it sharper.  At the moment, the e-puck can't detect the lines while turning around, and may also be unable to detect intersections.  So, going quite well.

Yes

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 11:08:51
(Also, final question, is the execution scheme gonna change between webots 2019 and 2020 ?)


Therefore, if understand correctly, the execution of the controller at time T is based on the data he retrieved from the timestamp T-1 during its execution at T ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 11:05:54
Yes.

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 11:05:42
(In the case the controllers and simulation step are the same, of course)


Ok, so the controller are executed before the physics (from ODE ?)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 11:03:26
Ok it works in this order (to summarize), at each step:

  - the controller request is read (i.e. the force is applied).

  - the physic step is executed.

  - the new state of the sensors is sent back to the controllers.



Of course this is in the case where the controller and simulation steps are the same.

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 11:00:47
Hi `@David Mansolino` , thank you

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 10:58:00
Hi `@Gautier A.` yes they are synchronized, let me check for the exact order.

##### Gautier A. 12/12/2019 10:55:25
(I'm mainly interested on the wb\_supervisor\_node\_add\_force function that are gonna be available in Webots 2020, and I want to understand how it interacts with ODE and, for exemple, if they (ODE and the controller) are "executed and synchronized" at the same timestamp)


And does this execution scheme is gonna change between webots 2019b and 2020a ?


How does an execution of a robots's controller/supervisor is inserted in the "global execution scheme" of a simulation ?


Hello, I have a question on the execution scheme

`@Nocturnal Warfare` you're welcome

no, for the moment we don't plan to improve the editor, even if we know that it is limited

##### JasonChen 12/12/2019 09:21:33
Hello, if I want to add more friction to my floor, how can I do that?

Right now, the robot slips all the time.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:20:42
Thank you by the way, you help has been invaluable


i think thats for another day lol, are there any plans to add version control or code autofill to the built in editor cuz those are the two main reasons i wanted to use VS Code

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:16:03
Yes, using the Supervisor API: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_set\_mode](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_simulation_set_mode)

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:15:20
is there a way send simulation commands from the code? like pause, reset, etc?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:14:47
no idea why it doesn't work form the console.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:14:34
that other one was the .env file


```{

``` is the json

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:13:58
the json looks correct

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:13:56
WTF, now it works.... why doesnt the console work tho?


```PYTHONPATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin
``` is my .env that is loaded using the launch.json


........


not from console, but from VS Code

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:12:10
yes, can you also try to set the WEBOTS\_HOME variable: ``set WEBOTS\_HOME=C:\Program Files\Webots``?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:12:06
wtf it started working


thats all correct right? cuz thats currently what they are


`PYTHONPATH: C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37`

`PATH: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\; C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller; C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin`


didnt help


ok

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:06:50
yes, you are right and you probably also have tp add C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin to the PATH as well.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:04:58
my python installation couldnt be the issue correct since it runs fine in the Webots application right?


when I was looking into integrating with PyCharm it said something about adding the mingw64\bin folder as an environment variable or something, is that something not necessary here?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 09:03:05
yes, but I'm now checking on a different machine

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 09:01:24
is it loading on your side fine?

grrr... still failed


ok so i have the \lib\controller, \python37, \lib\controller\python37 in my path now

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:55:56
yes, you need to add it to the PATH too

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:55:07
crap, now it doesnt recognize python cuz that path is gone lol


got it thanks

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:54:16
if you type ``set PATH=`` you will completely clean it

if you type ``set PATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;`` you will set it only to the Webots lib/controller folders

to append you have type something like this ``set PATH=<new path>;%PATH%``

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:52:29
how do you set the path variable versus just appending it?


yeah adding the .pyd didnt do anything

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:48:53
I doubt this is the issue, but you can try. I would also try to clean the PATH variable in the terminal and make it link only to the two Webots folders and to the python 37 folder

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:47:35
like import \_controller.pyd


i wonder if we switch the import in the controller.py to specify the .pyd extension

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:47:00
but it doesn't find \_controller. on my system I got this error when PATH was not set

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:46:06
i can type controller.py from the console, and it opens that file, so im guessing it is finding that path fine

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:44:48
it could be that PATH contains other resources that are conflicting with the latest Webots version


the error you get is probably due to the PATH and not to PYTHONPATH

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:42:59
or is that what that python code checks?


how do we make sure the pythonpath is working?


import still failing


both echo and python see both lib\controller and lib\controller\python37

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:41:05
or from python 
```import os
print(os.getenv('PATH'))
```

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:40:54
yeah both of those new paths are in there

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:39:50
yes, with `echo %PATH%`

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:39:20
is there a way to verify that the path is actually getting set?


nope

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:38:12
sorry I just edited the previous message


and if you set the path to:

```
set PATH=C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37;%PATH%
```

no this sets only the PATH, for the PYTHONPATH type:

```

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:33:20
`set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37` this does both?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:32:58
running the two commands I wrote you

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:32:19
how do you set both python path and path?


im trying now

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:32:03
does it work for you as well?


yes, I set both the PATH and PYTHONPATH and then started python and the import was fixed

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:31:20
and it worked?


so you ran that in CMD, then python, then import controller?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:29:16
I could make it work on my system from CMD by also updating the PATH before running python: 

`set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller;C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37`

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:16:50

oh ok

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:04:52
no, it contains bytes and not text

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:03:54
also is that \_controller.pyd supposed to be a text file? because neither VS Code nor notepad++ can read it

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:03:42
theoretically this makes sense, but I'm not sure

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:02:33
am i right in thinking that if VS Code can see controller.py, and import it properly, it should be able to see \_controller and import that as well?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 08:02:12
If I'm not wrong the the .pyd takes preference over the .py

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 08:00:04
is that the file that is referenced by the import \_controller?


yes it has that

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:50:14
I'm trying to understand why the uninstaller didn't work correctly, and sometimes the directories are not deleted if the files have beed modified

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:49:40
weird it still cannot find that \_controller, the lib folder only has controller.py, vehicle.py and \_controller.pyd, vehicle.pyd fyi. I assume the \_controller its looking for is a .py not a .pyd correct?


i mean what do you mean by touch? like modify? because i have been adding that folder to the VS code workspace and idk exactly what that does

no

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:46:50
just for info did you touch any file in the `<webots>\lib` folder?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:46:36
yeah it look like it was a leftover from the previous install, new install only has the controller folder,


i will try reinstalling again and make sure to delete the folder before install of 2020a

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:42:59

oh ok

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:42:11
the Webots\lib\python* folder should not exist

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:42:10
or just in the lib\controller\python37?


should all 6 be in both locations?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:41:41
Ok, thank you. I will check but this seems an error of the installer

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:41:02
`C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\python37` The first has both controller.py, vehicle.py and \_controller.pyd, vehicle.pyd while the latter only has the \_controller.py and vehicle.py


ok i figured as much thank you anyway

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:35:14
The controller need the Webots libraries to run so you should link to them on all the machines. You can set other environmental variables on your system to make it more generic (for example using a variable fot the Webots installation directory) but other than this I don't see any other things that could not be hard coded

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:31:28
BTW its still not finding the \_controller file, failing with the same error


like to get my controller to run externally i have to create PYTHONPATH variables that tell the program to look in a certain directory shown below:

`PYTHONPATH = C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\controller\python37; C:\Program Files\Webots\msys64\mingw64\bin; C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\python37;`

But I was wondering if there is a more generic way to do that if I want to run this code on multiple computers where that path isnt necessarily valid, so I was wondering if there is any way to get the Webots Directory dynamically versus having it hard coded

`@nap` Hi


`@Nocturnal Warfare` what do you mean exactly?

##### nap 12/12/2019 07:22:13
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` hello.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:21:54
is there a way to dynamically get the webots install directory, for the purposes of environment variables and transferring between computers?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:20:16
Yes, but the Windows installer should do it automatically.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:19:48
do i have to uninstall 2019b first?


sweet thank you ill give that a try

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:19:23
We are about to release it (probably next week)


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly\_11\_12\_2019](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases/tag/nightly_11_12_2019)


yes, but there are some libraries missing in the Windows package. You should try to use the nightly build of R2020a

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:19:04
when will that fixed be pushed to the live release?


I am simply trying to do external controller creation in VS Code that allows me to start simulation from the editor

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:17:18
ok, this is probably due to a bug that we fixed recently: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1131](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1131)

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:16:40
yes

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:16:34
yes, sorry, R2019b . And on which platform? Windows?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:16:13
2019b? yes i just did a fresh install which fixed my previous issue of that \_controller.pyd and \_vehicle.pyd not even existing which cause the controller to not run at all

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/12/2019 07:15:24
`@Nocturnal Warfare` are you using Webots R2010b revision 1?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 07:14:30
anyone have any ideas why it cant find \_controller but has no issues finding controller since both are in the same folder?

%end


this is so annoying, it saying it cant find \_controller.py now, even though it literally in the same directory of controller.py, which is what is calling for the import of \_controller

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:58:49
brb


Yes, that aspect is much easier to manage in Linux/Macos.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:57:22
yeah im currently on windows, trying to mess with the environment variables in order to make VS code see the necessary modules

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:56:36
I haven't used Windows for any coding in a while.


In linux I use CodeBlocks for the controllers and was able to build directly from the C::B IDE.  On MacOS, which I'm on right now, unfortunately there is no working C::B available, so I normally use Xcode (which I hate).


Since there have been some substantial API changes, I decided that I would get my controller working first, then worry about CLI building.


I'm migrating my project from Webots7 to the current OS one.


I'm currently using the built in editor because the the build fails from the command line.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:52:39
nice

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:52:30
Success here too.  Needed "camera" instead of "Camera".  lol

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:52:13
have you had any luck setting up an external controller through something other than the built in editor like Visual Studio Code?


hey it works, like if i just do 
```leftMotor = Motor('left wheel motor')
rightMotor = Motor('right wheel motor')` instead of `#leftMotor = robot.getMotor('left wheel motor')
\#rightMotor = robot.getMotor('right wheel motor')
``` it works fine


no i can manipulate the functions associated with them, just the code does not autofill when i put a '.' for instance, where when i do the same with the robot, it does

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:38:20
and for the encoders, if you're using them, use "left wheel sensor", "right wheel sensor"


try "left wheel motor"  and "right wheel motor"


Yes it does have a cam defined in its proto:  DEF EPUCK\_CAMERA Camera

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:36:23
so im messing around with the motors now, when you make a robot object, and then try to get robot.getMotor('left motor') or whatever the name of the motor is on the robot, it doesnt seem to return as a motor object, at least visual studio code and pycharm are recognizing it as a motor. on the other hand, both of those editors recognize robot properly and have code filling for its respective functions, do you have any idea why that is? should i make a motor object on its own in the code?

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:33:28
Thanks.  I had a look, but it's not an E-Puck (whose PROTO is very different).

The Robot in that example has a Camera Node, but the E-Puck doesn't (but I'm going to check the default proto to see if it is there).

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:25:17

Can someone recommend a C++ example that uses an Epuck with its camera please?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:21:39

Usually you should export the path to webots.

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:11:09
no, what environment variables do i have to set?

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:10:29
Yes, doing C bindings.  I don't program much in Python, but from the 'null bytes' message, maybe the C controller isn't being found?  Have you set the necessary environment variables?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:08:51
im guessing that the \_controller is the C controller module


line 3 is just the import in the controller:

`from controller import Robot, Motor, Camera`

line 15 is from the Python API files, so line 15 of the controller.py imports \_controller:

```# Import the low-level C/C++ module
if __package__ or "." in __name__:
    from . import _controller
else:
    import \_controller
```

##### nap 12/12/2019 06:05:35
are you sure there should be an underscore in front of \_controller?


What are lines 3 and 15?

##### Nocturnal Warfare 12/12/2019 06:02:15
I am trying to go through the tutorials and I'm running into an issue with running my custom controller for the epuck, this is the error the console pops out:

```INFO: e-puck_go_forward: Starting controller: python.exe -u "e-puck_go_forward.py"

Any ideas as to what is causing "ValueError: source code string cannot contain null bytes"

##### nap 12/12/2019 05:57:40
Please, and thanks.


The documentation about the E-Puck gives extensive details about how the camera works and what methods are available for use.  However, there is no code that shows how to actually use it.

Can anyone suggest a link to the right place in the documentation?


If I try to enable the cam using "myCam->enable(2 * TIME\_STEP);

my controller crashes.


I get an error "Warning: "Camera" device not found."


I'm having a little difficulty getting the E-Puck camera to work when using a C++ based controller.

I have included the library and defined a pointer as "Camera* myCam"

Later, when I initialise it using:

myCam = this->getCamera("Camera");

(Where 'this' is a subclass of Robot)

Webots uses two different time steps:



The simulation step (specified in the Scene Tree: WorldInfo.basicTimeStep). It actually is the time which calculates the simulation step. i.e. physics if used. means it adavqances the simulation. On the other hand the control step (specified as an argument of the wb\_robot\_step function for each robot) is the time which controls the control loop it take cares of sensors and actuators

ok, thanks... what line of code do you recommend to declare that?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 15:19:03
All of this is in "simulated time", it's the virtual time of the simulation (which can be slower or quicker than the real true time).


But very basically, when you call the wb\_robot\_step(period), the controller is blocked for the "period" time. The commands are sent to Webots. Then one or several physics steps can be executed in the meantime, for a "period" duration. And finally the sensor feedback is sent to the controller just before continuing its execution.

`@chamandana` I found and fix the memory leak issue that I can reproduce from your simulation: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1181](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1181)

##### aysegulucar 12/11/2019 14:59:58
why


Hi, when my controller transferring  to real robotis-op2 , I received the error "Unable to establish connection with the robot.

Connection error: server identity not verified". However it works at visual taking, that it is connected.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 14:38:50
I don't know how your controllers were working before. But a main() was always required.


I cannot explain this, it's not related with Webots.

##### nap 12/11/2019 14:37:26
Cheers.  All our controllers have used a run() method, but I just followed what some others had done.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 14:35:56
Mmmm. The controller is indeed a standalone executable linked with a shared library (libController) dialoging with Webots. So the main() method is used directly. But it has been always the case, and Webots never had a `run()` method.

##### nap 12/11/2019 14:04:13
`@Fabien Rohrer` : The old Webots 'run()' method is gone now, and the main() method is used directly instead of a sub-class.  So the controller is a standalone executable that links to webots.

Is this a correct interpretation?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 13:33:22
the 3d window should be selected to deal with the keyboard events. In this case the keyboard events are sent to every controllers. If only one robot is selected, then the keyboard events are only sent to the selected robot.


you're welcome üòâ

##### juanrh 12/11/2019 13:31:29

yeah, it was that


no, let me try that

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 13:29:05
Hi, do you select the robot in the 3D window before trying to use the keyboard?

##### juanrh 12/11/2019 13:28:13
I'm on Fedora 30 installed through snap. Any idea what is wrong here?


Hi, I'm trying to launch the python example [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/python](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/python) but the keyboard is ignored.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/11/2019 11:56:17
`@nap`, you should probably start from one of the controller provided within Webots and then change it step by step to integrate your controller inside.

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:49:23
My code builds, but nothing happens in the simulator, and once I enabled the LED and LightSensors on the robot, the controller crashes. üò¶


`@Fabien Rohrer` : I'm having a little difficulty understanding how to transition from DifferentialWheels to the other classes;  two HingeJoint, RotationalMotor and PositionSensor nodes, but whilst still using the GCTronic e-puck.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 11:22:48
`@nap` This seems to be correct: what disturbs you?


I will take a closer look at this.


`@chamandana`  I can indeed reproduce a huge memory request at the begining of your simulation, in Webots. ~100Mo per second. But it stabilized after a while at 3.0Go (which is big).

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:18:54
and that's what's generated the above XML that is in my .wbt file.


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Ok, that's what I've done.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 11:17:58
`@nap` This seems correct, just select the E-puck.proto from the "Add new node" dialog (as you suggest).

##### nap 12/11/2019 11:17:05
Sorry, I want to be able to see an e-puck robot in my simulation, without needing to create my own skins, etc.


And what do I select from within Webots when I use the "Add New -> PROTO nodes (Webots Projects)"?

##### chamandana 12/11/2019 11:15:44
`@Fabien Rohrer` In the above example (original version) i've sent there is no code running. It's just the world. Can you examine it and tell me what might be wrong please. thanks

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 11:15:03
`@nap` Sorry, but I don't understnad. Could you clarify your question?

This is the good way to include the e-puck.

##### nap 12/11/2019 10:55:49
And that instead I should define the PROTO structure using the above example? (Which looks to me to have 3 (or 4 if you robots if you count the supervisor).


My world .wbt file includes a reference to an e-puck proto as follows:



E-puck {

  translation -0.165 0 0.83

  controller "epuckwhiteboard"

  groundSensorsSlot [

    E-puckGroundSensors {

    }

  ]

You should rather take a look at other differential wheels robots, typically this example:


This is a complex robot window, moreover it's deprecated. This is not a good example for you üò¶

##### nap 12/11/2019 10:42:16
But, I might be lucky...  I found some 'botstudio' thing for the e-puck.  It's in C++.  Could you shed some light on what this does?  Its located at:

/Applications/Webots.app/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/robot\_windows/botstudio/e-puck


Ic.  I did notice a number of items relating to cross-compiling.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 10:39:12
Not in my knowledge, the reason is that the e-puck is very related to C (originally at least), because to be able to cross-compile code on it.

##### nap 12/11/2019 10:37:58
Would you know of any sample C++ code for an e-puck?  All the examples in Webots seem to be either in C or use bsg files.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 10:20:03
The e-puck proto model contains already this modification, but you need to modify your controller accordingly.


You need to use the Robot node instead, and 2 motorized HingeJoints


DifferentialWheel node has been dropped.


Normally we have a very good backward compatibility, but for sure, time to time, we need to break things.

Oh I undestand what's going on.

`@Fabien Rohrer` : Ok, I added: #include "<webots/DistanceSensor.hpp>", and it's built.  So I'm wondering if there is some sort of migration guide as I have other more complicated projects.


`@Fabien Rohrer` : As a reference, the code is in my repository on github @ [https://github.com/Napoleon-BlownApart/IdempotentPlanningProtocol/tree/master/webots/controllers/epuckMeanderLinesByGSM](https://github.com/Napoleon-BlownApart/IdempotentPlanningProtocol/tree/master/webots/controllers/epuckMeanderLinesByGSM)


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Yes, both includes are in the cpp file.


Yes, both of those includes are in the cpp file.


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Now it's working with the original code, using xcrun to retrieve the path.  That is really strange!!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:57:25
MACOSX\_SDK\_PATH should be defined correctly, otherwise it is for sure not working later...


Are you sure that "#include <webots/DifferentialWheels.hpp>" is included in "epuckMeanderLinesByGSM\_Behaviour.cpp"? This is a typical build error occuring when the class definition is not found.

##### nap 12/11/2019 09:56:07
`@Fabien Rohrer` :  lol.  With them removed, I've moved on to another error in the Makefile, but this is not something like the above.


(My Q)

In W7 (using C++), I was able to include:

  #include <webots/Robot.hpp>

  #include <webots/DifferentialWheels.hpp>

in my controller and then be able to use the various sensors.

Now I'm getting an error:

  *epuckMeanderLinesByGSM\_Behaviour.cpp:121:14: error: member access into incomplete type 'webots::DistanceSensor'*

So it seems that I need to change which headers I include.

I'm wondering if this information can be found anywhere?  Something that summarises how things have changed?

##### nap 12/11/2019 09:52:06
There is a error in 76.  The "$(" in front of the *wildcard* command, and its trailing parenthesis, need to be removed.

I can post it as an issue on github if you like.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:49:26
Ok, please ask your questions üòâ


yes, the `xcrun` is executed by bash, it returns a path, and it's existence is checked by the wildcard Makefile function. This should work, you're the first user who is annoyed by this line.

##### nap 12/11/2019 09:47:37
But I have another question at the moment, because it seems I can build inside Webots itself.  So, whilst I really need to be able to build from the terminal later, I am trying to get my old E-Puck Controller going first.


Oh, but the way the line is coded, it's being interpreted as a bash command.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:45:54
`@nap` The wildcard is simply a way to check that the file exists in the Makefile syntax.

##### nap 12/11/2019 09:42:48
`@Fabien Rohrer` : BTW, I like the way the 'pinned' messages have been utilised.  Good feedback.


`@Fabien Rohrer` : lol, it's still giving the same error after I replaced the assignment with  a static path.

There is something wrong in line 76::   ifeq ($(wildcard $(MACOSX\_SDK\_PATH)),)

The  MACOSX\_SDK\_PATH variable has the correct path (including the extension).



I've had a quick check to see what 'wildcard' does, but haven't found anything yet.  So I have no idea what its purpose is,

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/11/2019 09:07:26
This may cause the memory leak too. But I would recommend you to switch to Webots R2020a as soon as we release, because we improved the memory usage of Webots (the "develop" nightly builds are already solving this).

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1177](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/pull/1177)


This is a cryptic message from our API, I will solve this in the next release:


> while (wb\_receiver\_get\_queue\_length(receiver) > 0) {

>     const char *buffer = wb\_receiver\_get\_data(receiver);

>     // Do something with the buffer.

>   }


So you should modify your controller like this:


It is required to call wb\_receiver\_get\_queue\_length() before wb\_receiver\_get\_data(), but the warning in case this is not fulfilled is cryptic: invalid device tag.

Hi `@Uncle Ducky` Webots doesn't provide such example, however you might either use Radar ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar?tab-language=c](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/radar?tab-language=c)) or smart camera ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=c#wb\_camera\_recognition\_get\_objects](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/camera?tab-language=c#wb_camera_recognition_get_objects)) to detect position of objects relative to the robot and them move toward it.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 16:24:55

`@nap` if you run the simple http server from a Webots installation folder (installed from any package) it should work out of the box. From the Git repo you first need to run `python local_exporter.py` in the `<WEBOTS>/docs` folder

`@Stefania Pedrazzi` :  I've cloned the repo, run the simple http server and browsed the url you gave.  However, I'm not getting anything useful.  It appears to me that I need to build the documentation using something like Doxygen, first?


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Yes, I'm using a RectangleArena (and its default proto) with FloorAppearance and WallAppearance stanzas that have the PBR code.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 10:24:45
`@Gautier A.` About the supervisor instantiation, why not directly set the translation/rotation when calling the import function? It seems simpler and more robust. (Do you understand what I'm speaking about?)


`@Gautier A.` Ok, the axis seems indeed to be correct. So the next step is to dig into the Connector fields.


`@nap` thank you for the feedback, I also advise you to use our PROTO to manage floors and walls, typically the RectangleArena PROTO: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-floors#rectanglearena](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/object-floors#rectanglearena) It is simple to set, and more robust on long term.

`@Dorteel` Ok, I think I see the issue. When is installing from the Ubuntu store (aka snap), it runs with restricted privileges, this may cause issues to detect external Python binaries. You could either uninstall Webots and reinstall it from the tar.bz2 package (cf. [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/releases)) or use external controllers mechanism which should prevent this limitation (cf.

##### Gautier A. 12/10/2019 10:12:33
Also, its not really visible but it's a supervisor that instanciate the tiles and, after instanciating them, move them to the correct coordiante and orientation. The "connectors" works when it's placed and locked manually before the simulation begins, but the "problem" is when we use the supervisor to instanciate the proto of the object with the connector.


`@Fabien Rohrer`  I think the axis are "correct". I delted the shape of the connector and just have the "connector" in the Tree object to show only its coordinate system

Thank you `@Fabien Rohrer` , unfortunately I don't know much about modifying the PATH, it's a desktop from the university that we got the error on, it works perfectly on my own computer. From what I could read online, I tried exporting the virtual environment's path to PYTHONPATH, but that didn't solve it.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/10/2019 09:32:27
for the reference manual the URL is `http://localhost:8000/?book=reference&page=index`


you should simply start a python HTTP server:

1. go to the `<WEBOTS>/docs` folder

2. start the python HTTP server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

3. then from your browser open `localhost:8000` and you should get the documentation


yes, it works from the Webots package too, I just checked


I'm not sure that this works with the released Webots package too


`@nap` if you clone the Webots github repository you should be able to run the documention on your browser offline

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:25:31
I understand this, this is an interesting missing feature, I will keep it in mind.

##### nap 12/10/2019 09:24:43
True, but then I have the latency accessing the web.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:24:10
To be honest, googling our doc is very powerful, we are well referenced: "webots lidar", "webots using python", etc.


Unfortunately no.

##### nap 12/10/2019 09:21:30
`@Fabien Rohrer` : Ok, I'll do that.

Another question:  Is there a search function in the Off-line User Manual?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:20:27
About the TexturedBackground node, I recommend you to add one, it would increase A LOT the rendering quality of your simulation.


Ok, it seems that the only problematic point is the Appearance node then, if you follow the instructions above, the migration would work smoothly.

##### nap 12/10/2019 09:18:52
So, no TexturedBackground.  But let me go through the rest and see if it works.


I'm only using a .wbt for this, and in its XML, I have the following the solid I'm going to fix first:

Solid {

  translation 0 0.025 0.82

  children [

    DEF Static\_Obstacle Shape {

      appearance Appearance {

        texture ImageTexture {

          url [

            "textures/do\_not\_enter.png"

          ]

        }

      }

      geometry Box {

        size 0.05 0.05 0.05

      }

    }

  ]

  name "fixed01"

  boundingObject USE Static\_Obstacle

}


`@Fabien Rohrer` : Thanks!!  I'll do that now and see how I go.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/10/2019 09:13:25
Let us know if you encounter issues during your migration üôÇ


>>> PBRAppearance {

  roughness 1

  metalness 0

  baseColorMap ImageTexture {

    url "path/to/your/texture.jpg"

  }

}


For the textures in particular, you should use this PBRAppearance template:


3. An iteration on the light fields is also often required.


2. Replace every Appearance node by the PBRAppearance node, and update their fields: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pbrappearance](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/pbrappearance)


1. Remove the Background node and replace it by a TexturedBackground instance.


You should change the following in your .wbt and .protos files:


`@nap` Between Webots 7 and R2019b, we changed our rendering engine and introduced PBR, HDR backgrounds etc.

Hi everyone

I have a project from Webots 7 that I'm migrating into Webots 2019b r1.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 16:23:25
Worse case you can remove it from the 'lib' folder (this will not prevent Webots from working as it is not used directly by Webots)

Is there a way to override opencv2.4 used by webots?


yes I believe that is what I am doing but it is linking libopencv\_core.so.2.4 instead of libopencv\_core.so.3.2

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 16:19:46
That's indeed possible, we are currently improved the library hierarchy to avoid polluting the controller path with any external libraries (such as opencv).

##### lgrobots 12/09/2019 16:18:35
I have done that and it seems to be conflicting with opencv2.4 which is included in webots

okay, thank you for your time üòÑ I'll try that

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:59:34
Otherwise, I would recommend you to try to run `webots/projects/samples/devices/worlds/distance_sensor.wbt` and edit the associated robot controller which works retrieving distance sensor values. Then, compare it with yours.

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:58:59
yeah. üòÑ it didn't help

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:58:30
Can you try ? I would be surprised however if that helps.

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:57:55
what if I try remove #include range\_finder.h

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:57:39
And that's probably the cause of your problem, not being able to retrieve distance sensor values.


You shouldn't.


So, I don't understand why you get these warnings...

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:56:39
yeah

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:56:01
So, there may be something wrong in your code. Did you include properly `<webots/distance_sensor.h>`?

##### chamandana 12/09/2019 14:56:01
I get another error warning: implicit declaration of function 'wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable'; did you mean 'wb\_range\_finder\_enable'? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:55:33
The warning you get looks wrong as `wb_distance_sensor_get_value` for sure returns a double value. See [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#distancesensor-functions)

it says they expected an int

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:53:01

it returns 0.000 once %f is used

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:52:24
`wb_distance_sensor_get_value` returns a double not an int => you should use `%f` in your printf

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 14:52:18
OK, then it's not a problem with the name, but rather with the behavior of the sensor.

Yes, you just have to make sure that the model is exported in meters.

##### Hayden Woodger 12/09/2019 12:19:49
Thank you! I will use blender in future with this add-on. 

After you've exported to VRML from blender, will the model in Webots be accurate in dimensions?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/09/2019 12:17:32
Hi `@Hayden Woodger`, yes to import your model or project (if not already developed with Webots) in Webots you have to export to VRML. The reason is that Webots format is an extension of VRML. But if you are using Blender, we provide a tool to export your Blender project directly to Webots format: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)

##### Hayden Woodger 12/09/2019 11:49:03
Hi there, i can't seem to import any file types other than VRML97. I've read it's a very old format. Is this the best we can do?

ok, thanks.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 05:44:13
Let me check.


Oh, I get the point, now. Sorry it seems indeed there is a mistake

##### JasonChen 12/09/2019 05:42:53
which is weird for the function "wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_number\_of\_contact\_points(my\_solid)"


yes

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 05:42:28
noderef and index?

##### JasonChen 12/09/2019 05:40:52
can you please have a check


`@Fabien Rohrer`


you see, you have only one parameter here.


I mean the wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_number\_of\_contact\_points(my\_solid) has another parameter in matlab


no, no, no

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/09/2019 05:39:06
So the second parameter of wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point() is the polygon index. This function should be called several times until it returns NaN to get the polygon coordinates.


>>> for (int p=0; p < wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_number\_of\_contact\_points(my\_solid); p++) { // foreach polygon

    const double *polygon\_points = wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point(my\_solid, p); // get the polygon coordinates

  printf(¬´¬†polygon %d\n¬†¬ª,  p);

  int c = 0;

  while (true) {

     if (isnan(polygon\_points[3 * c])

      break; // no more points for this polygon 

    printf(¬´ point %f %f %f\n¬†¬ª,

      polygon\_points[3 * c],

      polygon\_points[3 * c + 1],

      polygon\_points[3 * c + 2]

    );

    c++;

  }

}


So this function should be used as follows (in C but in Matlab, it‚Äôs the same logics):


When an objet collides, it can have several contact polygons.


wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_contact\_point() is supposed to be called several times.


Ok I see. This is a bit weird to use...


`@JasonChen` let me check... normally the matlab API is a direct match of the C API...


The PROTO mechanism is quite simple, it only hide some node hierarchy in a file, with custom fields. It could be extended with a scripting language (lua as a template language). This is extremely powerful, but it requires to be expert in the Webots hierarchy nodes.

But we strongly recommend to use the latest version (R2019b)


`@White` as documented here if you use an old version of Webots you need indeed an email and password, but you can but any email and set the password to 'webots': [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/general-faq#can-i-still-use-a-webots-version-before-the-r2019a-release](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/general-faq#can-i-still-use-a-webots-version-before-the-r2019a-release)

Hi there, how can I manipulate an object handle in python please?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/06/2019 11:14:18
Non semi-transparent (transparenci != 0.0) object might be affected too.

##### lf\_lidar\_support 12/06/2019 11:02:11
Objects are only transparent if they have transparentcie = 1? right?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/06/2019 11:00:56
Lidar do not detctes transparent objects so this might be the problem, if the body of the Elisa is transparent the lidar might missed it.

##### lf\_lidar\_support 12/06/2019 11:00:05

I am doing the same thing but except I am taking robot name as an argument to set its velocity to zero

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/06/2019 08:27:06
For example here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosMotor.cpp#L108](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosMotor.cpp#L108)

OK I'll check that

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/06/2019 08:26:22
Ok then I don't see any obvious reason for this to fail. Maybe adding some print in the ros controller to check if the service messages are received and processed is a good way to go for debugging

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/06/2019 08:25:32
Yes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/06/2019 08:25:20
And then are you calling the step service of both robot ?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/06/2019 08:23:42
So I can see both are services are being called


Yes I am logging the info with the robot names as well

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/06/2019 08:22:46
`@Tahir` sorrry no idea where this could come from. Are you sure you are sending these zero to both robots ?


`@seppl2018` Webots is using the port '8873' to communicate with SUMO, it is possible that on your computer this port is not available and therefore Webots can't communicate. You shoudl try to change the port with the correspondign field of the SumoInterface node.


`@chamandana` there is indeed no argument as the `wb_robot_get_custom_data` function will return the content of the customData field of the robot calling the function, this function is not linked with any device but with the robot directly.


`@askslk`, I am really sorry but it is very difficult to understand what is happenning without looking at your simulation.


`@White` we are currenlty updating our website and not all the features are yet available. However, you shouldn't need and accoutn to use Webots anymore, why do you want to create an account?

##### seppl2018 12/06/2019 06:33:02
The highway driving example does not work properly for me:



[sumo\_supervisor] Connect to SUMO... This operation may take a few seconds.

Hi, I have a problem is that I code a program use if fuction and camera to touch the ball.Once I touch the ball,touch sensor receive data, my next if function will call the car back to central point.But in real, my robot touch the ball but didnt goto next function, camera part still work and still go to touch the ball.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 12/05/2019 20:59:23
Hi

I am using webots ros controller on a custom robots in a multi robot industrial scenario. When two robots face each other, the controller stops sending the velocity commands, but the robots move with the last sent velocity command. So I have written a ros service which sends zero to the robot when velocity controller stops. I have got a strange behaviour that this service works for one robot and it stops but the other one moves with the last cmd.

Anyone have an idea what's could be the problem or a point where I am doing the mistake

Note that standard libraries can usually be used directly simply including them in the code. Not sure about socket.h


You should not copy them, but link them from the Makefile:  [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/05/2019 08:45:25
this is not specific to Webots, you should ask in a programming forum. But I can point you to an example where Emitter/Reveicer communication method is used.

can I get an example for shared memory or sockets please


oh okay üôÇ

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/05/2019 08:27:47
Otherwise any method for interprocess communication works also between Webots controllers (i.e. write/read to/from file, shared memory, sockets, etc.)


Yes, a common way is to use the Emitter/Receiver nodes.

##### chamandana 12/05/2019 08:24:54

Sure, I will try it now.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 17:27:57
Not very intuitive.


The center of vehicles is at the center of the 2 rear wheels.


To do so, just put the first truck at the world position 0 (or better, its radar), create a "Transform > Sphere", and move it at the location given by the azimuth+distance.


In this case, you will be sure of what the radar detects...


Quite archaic, but efficient.


What I would do is to create a sphere, and put it at the location indicated by the radar.


Isn't it the center of the other truck?

##### JoHn 12/04/2019 17:24:34
Sure, thank you very much for your answers `@Fabien Rohrer`


Now both trucks are very closed. The radar detects one object and the distance is 3.56 meters.

But the radar shows that the distance is 10 meters and only one object is detected.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 17:21:22
the lidar seems well oriented, the azimuth seems to indicate indeed something front. I cannot explain this 4 meters offset from the screenshot.

Hi guys, I'd like to ask a question when I add a radar to a truck in Webots. As can be seen from the screenshot, the truck on the right has a radar installed in the front , and another truck is very closed to the radar.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 12/04/2019 16:51:54
0.0x means the simulation is stopped.


Yes, basictimestep is a constant. The same rate for all the simulation.


Every 0.3 true seconds, the simulation speed is compared with the true time. This second value of the speedometer show the ratio with the true time. If you have 1.0x, you're close to the real time. If you have 2.0x you run twice faster than real time.

##### ClBaze 12/04/2019 16:50:00
the basictimestep is fixed right ?


what does the 0.00x means

Hi, the simulation refresh rate is given by WorldInfo.basicTimeStep which increases the simulation time and the physics engine by a constant rate. This time is virtual and is not linked with the true time, therefore a simulation can run faster or slower than true time. Robot controller are generally synchronized on this rate (or an integer multiple of it)

Greetings to all!

My small problem with textures jpeg on Windows and did not manage to be solved. Neither variables PATH, nor installation of different libraries jpeg decoding, has not passed. After investigation has seen that the read error arises in Qt class QImageReader but why he does not see library libjpeg-8.dll delivered in package Webots - I have not understood. Perhaps someone has an access to a code of this class going to release Webots? To clarify what path it searches for library of decoding and why does not find.

##### chamandana 12/04/2019 11:54:01

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/04/2019 11:53:23
Be also carfull with the 'maxRange' and 'occlusion' fields of the 'Recognition' node.


You have to make sure that all the objects you want to detect have a recognition color, a model and a boundign object set.

##### chamandana 12/04/2019 11:51:57
Is there a way? üôÇ

Does it has sense in your simulation?


Probably my hypothesis about rendering improvements is wrong then.


the bottleneck of your simulation comes from physics and/or your controllers and/or general Webots updates (node update, rendering sort, etc.)


This may mean several things...


It seems the bottleneck is on the CPU then.

##### Meisam 12/03/2019 13:03:57
`@Fabien Rohrer` Thank you. I have reduced ambient occlusion and texture quality to low. Also, I have disabled shadow and anti-aliasing options. However, they do not make tangible speedup.

`@ega` Please take a look at this example: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt) OpenCV is currently released in Webots, you can use it out-of-the-box


`@Meisam` Between these 2 releases, we increased the GPU load, mainly because of our migration to PBR, the use of big floating point textures for backgrounds, and postprocessing effects (bloom, global ambient occlusion, etc.). The Webots preferences contain an "OpenGL" tab where you could reduce parameters. You should try to reduce the texture quality, and the ambient occlusion quality. The next release of Webots will use less GPU memory, you could already try the latest nightly builds (develop) to give a try.

([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor) )


Hi guys! For some reason I can't access the supervisor documentation, were there any changes I'm not aware of?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 12/02/2019 07:46:49
`@YC`L#9474: you should run your simulation in real time mode (using the PLAY button). If the speedometer displays a value significantly lower than 1, that means your simulation is unable to run in real time (at the same speed as the real system). So, only in this case, you should adapt your simulation until it runs in real time. Reducing the `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep` is certainly going to speed-up your simulation, but there are other possibilities such as simplifying the simulation models or the robot controllers.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 12/02/2019 07:40:44
Hi  `@chenpixx`, you can use the supervisor API to import/move any node in the scene:

  - [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node)

  - [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f)

This way you can for example simply import a sphere shape and move it to the right foot sole position.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 12/02/2019 07:33:52
`@askslk` there are multiple techniques and algorithm to move a robot to a target point depending on the constraints and devices mounted on the robot (i.e. for example if the robot knows its current position, etc.). You should add more details about your scenario.


> hi, why after add a camera to my robot, the camera cant shot, just a plot of black

`@askslk` did you enable the camera in your robot controller?

##### lunarpulse 12/01/2019 23:36:16
`@David Mansolino` Thanks very much! I could not find this information online. fortunately, you provided in detail. Now I get all in sim time. Thanks again.

##### Yang Chen 12/01/2019 23:28:21
Thank you!


And when I set a robot arm to move a constant degree(eg. from 10deg to 30deg) by a given simulation time period, what is the kind of motion of the simulation every basic time step? Eg. sometime the simulation can not move the constant degree by a given time. By changing the given time, the simulation could done well. So I am wondering what's the motion style of the simulation, like how many degree the robot move every single basic time step or the robot just move to the goalÔºüAnd how can I find the exact time need to finish moving a constant degree? All are based on the same robot model with same max torque for the rotation motors, same mass of the robot.


Hi everyone. Recently, I want to compare the speed of a robot in simulation with the same robot in real life. In order to let the robot move forward, in simulation, when I use differnt basic time step  with all other parameters stay the same, the time to finish this same motion is differnt, and the speed by calculating the position of the robot over simulation time  is different too. And I see the user manual about basic time  step set-up. Does that mean I need tune the basic time step according to the real robot's speed, with the same parameters and controller betweem the simulation and real robot?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/29/2019 13:49:28
2. you can run Webots as a web server and user can only program the controller, such as what we did here: [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/)


1. You can set the controller to be 'extern' then the user can write his controller and launch it independently of Webots: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)


Yes, there are several way to do this:

##### Shadow 11/29/2019 13:41:42
`@David Mansolino` Thanks for the response, perhaps I can clarify what I'm looking for. I'm currently developing a world with supervisors to detect specific robot actions to gain points. Is there a way that the simulation can be run so that people can develop their own controllers for the robots, but not have the ability to view/edit the world (the node tree etc.) so the simulation is effectively running only the 3d viewing portion rendering the world.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/29/2019 13:35:58
Hi  `@Shadow`, yes if you download the webots package: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/download](https://www.cyberbotics.com/download)

You can run all the samples provided withing Webots without coding enything.

If you want to control the motion of your robot/object in Webots from another software, you can create a controller that will act as a bridge between Webots and your other software.

Is that what you would like to do?

##### Shadow 11/29/2019 13:30:22
Hi everyone, is there a possible way to create or use existing software to run a webots simulation without the developer environment webots initially provides, effectively to just run the 3d view? Thanks.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/29/2019 08:04:12
Hi `@askslk`, I am not sure to understand your question, but if you want to perform SLAM with a differential wheel robot in Webots you might be interested by [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27\_Robot\_Curriculum/Advanced\_Programming\_Exercises#SLAM\_](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cyberbotics%27_Robot_Curriculum/Advanced_Programming_Exercises#SLAM_)[Advanced]


Then both your nodes and bag should use simulation time (or at least record it too).


Then you have to set the 'use\_sim\_time' ROS parameter ([http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server](http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server)) to true.


First, you have to make sure that you did put in the controllerArgs field of your robot the following arguments: '--clock' and '--use-sim-time' (see v for more information)

Once the target file is chosen, the movie creation takes a while (see the log in the console)


Some information should be displayed in the Webots console.


A regular workflow is about to select "File / Make Movie...", click OK, run the simulation, select "File / Stop Movie", and finally choose the target file.


This warning occurs normally when no simulation steps occured between the beggining and the end of the movie recording.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/27/2019 09:50:44
2. make sure all your Solids nodes (maybe except the root one) have both bounding object and physics set


You should try to:

  1. remove useless transform (it is pointless to put a transform as parent of a solid)


Then in the children of your joint you have some useless transform and the endpoint Solid of the first joint doesn't have bounding objects and physics


It seems the hierarchy of your nodes is somehow wrong. You have a root node that has Physics without bounding objcet (this doesn't make sense) and then another Solid in the children at the same level than the joint that have bounding object (same size than root Solid) but no Physics


You're welcome

Here's a video to show tou


But it's still the end point of the slider joint (when I move the slider joint, the "robotic arm" floating stop to float and moves accordingly to the joint)


The unexpected behavior is that there seems to be "no constraint" on the Z axis : when a force is applied to the robotic arm, it just "kind off" seperate itself from the rest of the solid


and I put a robot (sample robot, abb I think) on the "end connector"


I have a world in Webots that consists in a rail (a solid that can move in one axis compared to another solid in reference) and a connector is fixed to the end of the rail

`@Dorteel` I can only tell that your python environment miss to load an internal resource: libmpi.so.20. The first thing to try is to locate this resource on your computer, and try to add in it LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH.

##### Dorteel 11/25/2019 12:07:39
Hi `@Fabien Rohrer` , the problem is, that it's only in WeBots that it doesn't work, it works in any other IDE (including PyCharm), that's why I referred to you guys. I use the Shebang line to define the environment if that's any help. But I'll try to find another solution, just thought you guys might know something about it.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 11:24:02
`@Dorteel` Sorry, I don't know about this error. It's likely to be an issue when importing a third party library. Could I kindly redirect you to the support of pycharm/python ?

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 11:23:06
Thank you a lot ! üôÇ

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tinkerbots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tinkerbots)


If you go in the way I suggest about to use a Supervisor to assembly the tiles, slots could be use to facilitate their assembly (cf. the tinkerbots examples)


`@Gautier A.` I would say that a slot is more a matter on how two protos are connected together.


`@Gautier A.` `@Stefania Pedrazzi` I confirm that a Group does not solve the issue, because currently a Robot cannot be inserted in it (but a Solid can).

##### Dorteel 11/25/2019 11:19:37
Do you have any suggestions?


Hi again guys, I run into a problem when trying to import some libraries from stable\_baselines, using the same environment I have no issues in PyCharm, so I'm not sure what the problem is

Also, wouldn't a "slot" works ?


Thanks you a lot


Both are very good idea ! I'm gonna test them out !

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 11:12:45
probably not,  just the Solid nodes

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 11:12:21
I'm testing this right now.


You're right, but I'm not sure we support this. Is it possible to add Robot inside a Group?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 11:11:01
What about using a Group as a top node? You will be able to add multiple independent Solid children nodes from the procedural PROTO

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 11:10:45
A better approach would be rather to create a PROTO per tile, and to assembly them using another mechanism, typically a Supervisor can import PROTO in a scene.


(our PROTO system should deal with multiple top nodes to be able to manage this case)


Because of this, and the fact that we do other assumptions on the top nodes, it seems unfortunately to be not possible to achieve this this way.


You unfortunately reached a limitation of our PROTO system which can handle only one root node.

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 11:03:10
That would be pretty nice  !


It's the fact that it's treated as a "big object", instead of little small objects, in prescence of force that I would like to correct

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 10:58:35
Could I modelize the "docking" of these differents object on Webots (and the necessary force to seperate themselves from the central dock) ? If not, how could I do in order that, even if these objects are generated by a lua proto, they're considered separated and with differents physics ?


I would like my "robot" to not be considered as a "big object" by my physics engine but "multiple object" docked in a central one


So, I have this proto node that generate some other other solid in its "children" thanks to some Lua. The  behavior of the proto in itself is what we excepted, the only thing is that we want to separate the "physics" of the different solid (exemple : At the end of the video, I apply a force on some of the mirror, and I would like that these mirrors "undocks" and just go the other way of the rest of the structure)

I have another question on a different topic, if I might ? üòÖ


Thank you a lot ! üôÇ


Ok, I totally understand your point of view

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 10:27:54
we currently do not provide better solution. But it would be possible to change our rendering engine to optionnaly sort polygons (but we should see a big interest in this topic, which is currently not the case).


This is good enough to render simple cases (rectangular glasses, etc.) but not to render well complex meshes.


Our solution is about to sort transparent objects according to their center, but not to sort polygons, because it has a big cost in term of performance.


transparent objects is a global issue in computer graphics, without perfect solutions.

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 10:22:01
If I need to have a transparent texture on an object though, how would I have to do to not encounter this kind of problem ?


It worked, thank you a lot !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 10:15:14
(do this for all your textures)

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 10:15:11
Ok, I'm gonna try that ! Thank you !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/25/2019 10:14:24
voila


To do so, simply open your image in Gimp, and select the "Layer / Transparency / Remove alpha chanel", and override your previous texture.


You can simply solving this by removing the alpha layer from your textures. This is a condition to switch the objects into the transparent render queue.


This is because your object is rendered as a transparent object.

##### Gautier A. 11/25/2019 10:12:05
these "bugs" of display only appear when I use textures. Without any textures, webots render the model prefectly fine


I used the blender addon for blender 2.79 to export it and transform it in proto

Thank you very much `@Stefania Pedrazzi` I'll try that!

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 08:37:05
Calling `(super, Robot).step()` vs `(super, CustomEnv).step()` you should be able to control which function is called.

##### Dorteel 11/25/2019 08:34:19
Yes, the controller needs to inherit methods with the same name from both parents, and I'm not sure how it works when these methods are used by other packages.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 08:34:16
This is a common programming issue that could be solved by specifying the class in the call: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3810410/python-multiple-inheritance-from-different-paths-with-same-method-name](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3810410/python-multiple-inheritance-from-different-paths-with-same-method-name)


Hi `@Dorteel`, if I understand correctly your issue is simply than both base classes have the same method name , is it correct?

##### Dorteel 11/25/2019 08:28:25
Hi! I'm trying to make parts of my WeBots simulation as a Gym environment for RL (python) ([https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/custom\_env.html](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/custom_env.html) ). However, having troubles with implementing it with the supervisor class. I was trying double inheritance, but didn't succeeed so far, as both Robot and Gym requires a step() function. Might be that there is just an easy programming workaround I don't know about? Any suggestions?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/25/2019 07:29:05
`@Prasad` I'm sorry that you have some issues using Webots and we are continuously trying to help you solving them. I'm also sure that there are workarounds for the coordinates issue and any other issue you will find. Please tell me if I'm wrong, but I have the feeling that you are trying to port one by one your Gazebo code in Webots and you are expecting that Webots works exactly the same way as Gazebo. But this is not the case, they are two different software that have been programmed independently following different standards. I think that to get the best from Webots (also in terms of performance) it would be better to try to understand how Webots works and adapt the code.


`@Prasad` in Webots it is possible to change the direction of the up vector and the direction of the north using the `WorldInfo.gravity` and `WorldInfo.northDirection` this should be sufficient to customize the global coordinates of the world. Please check the documentation `[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)` and try to play with these parameters. If it still you cannot achieve what you want, then you could open an issue and we will evaluate it.


`@Moumen` to start with Webots I suggest you to read the Tutorials ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)). Here it is also explained how to program a robot. If after checking them it is still not clear how to run some code, please don't hesitate to ask again.


`@SimonDK` to execute just one step you can set the mode to REAL\_TIME, run the  `wb_robot_step(time)` function where `time` corresponds to the worlds basic time step (to execute one step) and then set the mode to PAUSE.


As documented in the `Compass` node documentation page ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass?tab-language=python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass?tab-language=python)) the Webots north direction is the one set in the `WorldInfo.northDirection` field this is fully customizable and you are free to change it and adjust it to your needs. It "some north in infinity" and has nothing to do with the floor or any object in the scene. The Compass node works just fine in retrieving the orientation of a robot and that's what does: it returns the orientation of the device with respect to the `WorldInfo.northDirection`.


`@Prasad` yes it is possible to retrieve the Floor size. You have to use the Supervisor API ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_def](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=python#wb_supervisor_node_get_def)) to get the node and the  `Node.getField` (wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field) and `Field.getSFVec2` to retrieve the value of the "size" field. For an example you could for example look at the way the slave robots translation fields is read in the `projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt` sample simulation.

##### Prasad 11/25/2019 03:20:41
Also, sorry to say this. Camera does not work properly. Rover gets stuck repeatedly. Coordinates are flipped. I do not think I can build a production ready SITL with Webots. I am quite frankly disappointed with flipped coordinates. I am thinking about archiving my repository citing the same reason by tomorrow. I would appreciate any insight/input.


Also, I am facing one terrible problem which is significantly consuming my development time (which I believe is unnecessary). The Y coordinates in Webots is flipped. There should be one option for the user to select the direction of Y coordinates (with reference to the floor). Should I raise an enhancement issue regarding the same?

##### SimonDK 11/24/2019 22:35:17
In the Supervisor controller, there are options for reset, pause, set real time, run, and fast. Isn't there an option to execute one simulation step like there is from the menu inside Webots?

##### Moumen 11/24/2019 16:25:33
It probably doesn't work that way


I wanna just put some code and see if a robot moves


I'm kind of new to this stuff


How does webots work exactly

##### ZOLTAN OPS 11/24/2019 13:07:11
im new to webots


`@Fabien Rohrer`  how would I open a world with compass.c?

##### Prasad 11/24/2019 09:26:31
I have one more question. What does compass do? I believe it gives the orientation of the robot. But, where is the magnetic north? Is it the north of the webots floor or some north in infinity? Am I better off using gyro or should I use compass to get the orientation of the Pioneer rover?


I am using Python. Floor("floor") does not work. I was thinking about programmatically extracting the attributes of the floor in the controller


I am figuring out a workaround for the bug [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081)

Question: Can I get the floor size in the controller?

##### SimonDK 11/23/2019 15:12:59
Hi `@David Mansolino` , thanks for that. Have been trying it out, but every time I use any of those service calls from ROS, Webots crashes/freezes ü§îAny idea why? I am just running the Pioneer ROS example with Webots running on a remote machine. Everything works fine, can do mapping and control the robot.



Edit: figured it may be related to an issue on github, where the environment may freeze on Mac.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/23/2019 12:23:31
Hi `@SimonDK`, yes, you first have to make sure that the 'supervisor' field of your robot is set to 'TRUE' then you can use the supervisor services: 

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb\_supervisor\_simulation\_set\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb_supervisor_simulation_set_mode)

##### SimonDK 11/22/2019 23:59:03
I have a simulation connected with ROS and have access to the services. Is there a way to reset and pause the simulation from ROS?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/22/2019 19:03:56
The robot is a blue 2 wheeled robot equipped with a motorized yellow arrow. The controller makes in order that the yellow arrow point always the north, using the compass feedback.


Yes, there are other stuff. If you open this world in Webots, it will be self explanatory üòâ


You can put the Compass directly into the Robot.children.

##### ZOLTAN OPS 11/22/2019 18:23:37
For the compass, is there an object i need to make a child of the robot to put a compass on the robot?

Also the first one you posted, is that all code for one compass or is there other stuff in there with it like motors. `@Fabien Rohrer`

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 22:45:27
If you want to get directly Joystick inputs from your script without using Webots you might use OIS ([https://github.com/wgois/OIS](https://github.com/wgois/OIS)) directly in your script.


I am not sure to understand what you mean by bypassing Webots? If you want to use the Webots API you need Webots to run as it is Webots that is getting the joystick inputs and then transmit them to the controller.


HI `@nighthearing`, yes of course this is feasible. Please find an example that use the Joystick API to control a car using a G29 (or other steering wheel model) here (the example is in C++, but the Python API is exactly the same): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/racing\_wheel](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/racing_wheel)

##### nighthearing 11/21/2019 20:27:17
Hello. I'm about 1 hour into discovering webots. I've been looking for an approach to controlling the Logitech G29 steering wheel. Based on the documentation and input from `@Fabien Rohrer` back in September, it sounds like this is totally possible. I was hoping that I could just write a Python script to do this but my ignorance is getting the best of me. Should I be able to directly import the Joystick API (i.e., `from controller import Joystick API`) and connect to the steering wheel? 

```
from controller import Joystick
stick = Joystick()
stick.enable()
```

Edit: Also, can I bypass using the backend Webots server to use this API?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:58:39
Ah ok, sorry I misunderstood your question. Webots uses it's own rendering engine called wren: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/include/wren](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/include/wren)

And it also uses Qt to load images.

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 13:56:59
`@David Mansolino` Well, thanks! I have thought that processing of rendering of textures, is function not from API Webots, and internal.

`@KamiRonin` you can find more info about the Webots API here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/programming-fundamentals](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/programming-fundamentals)


`@Dorteel`, I had to slightly change your controller to make it run with my test world, but I have no crash. Can you please:

  1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of Webots.

  2. check that when you do both `obj = self.getFromDef('GOAL')` and `dest = obj.getField('translation')` None of the result are equal to `None`.

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 13:34:15
Well, thanks big for the help! I will try different libraries for operation with jpeg, one question, Webots engine important concrete name or what or API functions of such library?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:31:18
I am not familiar with GnuWin, but it is probably worth trying it.

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 13:23:00
`@David Mansolino` I am sorry, for my English! No, for me any package, framework or the software environment has not installed libjpeg.dll in Windows.

GnuWin will approach?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 13:19:47
`@Dorteel`, thank you I will try it and let you know


I am sorry but I do not fully understand your last message, Webtos does provide everyhing that you need to run it. However, it might happen that other software badly designed already intalled on your computer can 'corrupt' your Windows by adding some libraries (in your case libjpeg) that are not compatible with the ones used by Webots.

`@KamiRonin`, can you try temporarily just to remove completely all the content of your 'PATH' environment variable and then start Webots


`@Dorteel` , the fact that you did import the Solid before should not cause any issue. Would you agree to share your controller so that we can check what is happenning?

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 12:20:53
`@David Mansolino` I in all variables of environment PATH do not have paths to libraries libjpeg where to look - that it is necessary to register for Webots? Path addition to bin or lib has not helped folders Webots, he all as does not distinguish texture.

##### Dorteel 11/21/2019 12:18:09
The Solid I used is imported through importMFNode when running the controller, and it is not saved in the world file, could that be the issue?


There is the same implementation in the python example.wbt with the Robot teleportation, so have no idea what went wrong.

##### KamiRonin 11/21/2019 07:29:15
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` I reinstalled Webots twice. Once it was installed in folder Users/MyName, at times (having deleted and having cleaned system), I have forced it to be installed in Program files.

After the second installation, there was a first start and textures from jpg files were visible, but right after an output and an input anew in the program - they any more were not shown.

What paths need to be registered in PATH for Webots?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/21/2019 07:21:24
`@KamiRonin` no you don't have to convert the textures. JPG textures should work out of the box when installing Webots. If it doesn't then there could be some issues with the Webots installation or with your system PATH. I would first suggest you to download again Webots and reinstall it. If it still doesn't work we should inspect your environment settings.

##### KamiRonin 11/20/2019 17:31:24
Greetings to all.

Has installed Webots r2019b rev1 on Windows 10 and followed lessons from the documentation.

But in a window 3D I see that textures are not displayed, and to consoles writes "/Webots/projects/default/worlds/textures/gray\_brick\_wall.jpg ' is not a power of two: rescaling it from-1x-1 to 0x0." And "projects/default/worlds/textures/gray\_brick\_wall.jpg ': Unsupported image format.".

But after all it is textures from the delivery and with them it is obvious everything is all right.

After some search has found out that jpg/jpeg a file of textures the program rejects ANY. Accepts normally only png!



To me that to convert all textures installed with the program in png?

##### ClBaze 11/20/2019 14:05:16
Exact, I can see it. Thank you very much!

This option is stored as a string under the "General/extraProjectsPath" key.


Then the Webots preferences are stored into INI config files (one per Webots version) into your ~/.config/Cyberbotics directory. Please modify these files with care üòâ

This depends on the OS. On which OS are you working?

##### ClBaze 11/20/2019 13:59:36
It's working üôÇ . I suppose Webots saves its preferences to a file. Where can I find it ? I don't find it in its installation folder.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/20/2019 13:25:06
You could add there a path to a generic project directory containing your generic PROTOs. They should be defined in a "protos" directory (as usual in fact).


Ok, we have indeed a mechanism to set supplementary paths in order to search for general protos: it's about to add a directory in the "Webots Preferences / General / Extra Project Path".


I'm checking, at some point we had a mechanism to add a resource folder.


Hi clement.

##### ClBaze 11/20/2019 13:14:29
Hi guys! I've made several protos (1 folder per proto) in the main "protos" folder of my webots project. When I try to make another proto using these last ones, Webots console outputs: "error: Skipped unknown node "artag" or Proto". If I move all the protos in the same folder, I can reference them. What is the best way to make a proto that can be used by several protos ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/20/2019 08:49:08
`@Sohil` which transform do you want to publish? Currently it is not possible to retrieve directly the transform matrix from a parent node to a descendant node using the Webots API, but you can compute it in your controller program based on the camera and robot global position and orientation ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_orientation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab-language=ros#wb_supervisor_node_get_orientation))


`@JoHn` it is not possible to change the coordinate system of the Lidar device itself. The tilt will always be along the X axis of the Lidar device node and rotation along the Y axis (see the documentation [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar#field-summary](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar#field-summary)). About the graphical shape, you can add a Tranform inbetween to change it and if you need to change the coordinates of the Lidar device values you have to do it manually in the controller program.

##### Sohil 11/20/2019 04:25:36
Hi guys! I am working with Webots and ROS. I wanted to know if there is any neat way to publish transforms for suppose between cameras and robot?

##### JoHn 11/19/2019 18:43:13
Is there any chance to modify the default coordinate system of the lidar? Thanks a lot!


But apparently, the current lidar will not work because the laser beams are shooting to the ground and the sky.

(2 eulerAndAxis rotations are multiplied)


Here is a typical usage: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/devices/sick/protos/SickLdMrs.proto#L46](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/devices/sick/protos/SickLdMrs.proto#L46)


wbrotation.lua deals with some typical rotations issues you may have with Webots.


In the procedural PROTO, you have access to these modules: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/lua/modules/webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/lua/modules/webots)


Yes, there is, but a small/limited one üòâ

##### ClBaze 11/19/2019 12:59:32
If not, is there any recommendations on how and where to include such library so that it is accessible from lua in proto files ?


Does Webots include any lua module to calculate frame transformations and manipulate quaternions ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/19/2019 12:39:48

Otherwise the name is not protected correctly, and is interpreted by the wbt parser.

I didn't test, but this controller should do a "8". You should only adjust TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE


>>> from controller import Robot



robot = Robot()

timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE = 10.0   # 10 seconds to do a perfect circle? => to adjust



left = robot.getMotor("left wheel motor")

right = robot.getMotor("right wheel motor")

left.setPosition(float('inf'))  # Set motor in speed mode

right.setPosition(float('inf'))  # Set motor in speed mode



while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

    time = robot.getTime()

    if time < TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE:

      right.setVelocity(6)

      left.setVelocity(3)

    elif time < 2.0 * TIME\_FOR\_A\_CIRCLE:

      right.setVelocity(3)

      left.setVelocity(6)

    else:

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 09:48:06
Let me show you...


to do a 8, you have to do a circle, then switch the velocties.


your loop is a blocking infinite loop.


It's still because you don't step the simulator: cf my comment above.

##### HE110 11/19/2019 09:45:54
It is always still


from controller import Motor

from controller import Robot

rbt=Robot()



MAX\_SPEED = 6.28

TIME\_STEP = 32

left = Motor("left wheel motor")

right = Motor("right wheel motor")



right.setVelocity(6)

left.setVelocity(3)

while 1:

    right.setVelocity(6)

    left.setVelocity(3)


TIME\_STEP is always 32


Two circles likes "8"


How can i control it to move two circles?


Im going to try it,thank u

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/19/2019 09:20:56
secondly, your controller quits, because "t" reaches 10, and enter in the "quit"  section (the loop is broken)


with time\_step = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())


first of all, you need to replace time.sleep() by robot.step(time\_step)

##### HE110 11/19/2019 09:19:04

MAX\_SPEED = 6.28

left = Motor("left wheel motor")

right = Motor("right wheel motor")

t=0

right.setVelocity(6)

left.setVelocity(3)

while 1:

    time.sleep(1)

    t+=1

    if t<=5:

        right.setVelocity(6)

        left.setVelocity(3)

`@JoanGerard` it is a bad practice to run Webots as root. So please make sure that it works when you start Webots manually without root privileges. Then it seems that you installed Webots from the snap package. We never tested the streaming server with the snap version of Webots and it is very likely that it is doesn't work. I would suggest you to install Webots using the debian or tarball package [https://www.cyberbotics.com/download](https://www.cyberbotics.com/download)

##### JoanGerard 11/19/2019 01:43:46
So when I execute webots manually from the simulator server and I use the stream\_viewer example everything works good. 



The server.sh file needs to be executed with sudo command otherwise the simulator\_server.py crashes. The problem arises when the instance of Webots is lunched due to the connexion of a new client cause it is been executed as root. Do you have any idea on how I can solve this?

Please try it and let us know what you get.


You can retrieve the exact command used by the simulation server script to start Webots in the logs (usually `<WEBOTS_INSTALLATION>/resources/web/server/log/simulation/output.log`) and just remove the world path


For the connection issue, a first thing to test is to start webots manually on the simulation server and try to connect to it directly using the `streaming_viewer` page ([https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/web/streaming\_viewer](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/resources/web/streaming_viewer))


Hi `@JoanGerard`, the issue with the GPU detection is not related to the problem connecting to the simulation server. You can check which GPU is detected by webots by running `webots --sysinfo` in a terminal on the simulation server. Are your NVIDIA drivers up-to-date?

##### JoanGerard 11/18/2019 11:13:24
can you give me a hand with this?


I receive this message together with a "WebSocket network error: The operation couldn‚Äôt be completed. Connection refused" console message even though I have opened the ports from 81 to 3000 tcp on my simulator server to allow websockets communication

In that case you can take inspiration from our Docker procedure to run Webots without GUI: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Docker](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Docker)


Ok, so that might be the problem if you don't have any GUI interfac

`@JoHn` regarding your log, it seems that the Webots ROS controller crashes. And not Webots.

##### RossBatten 11/15/2019 03:05:21
I ended up getting it to work by swiching to vscode environment.  Still unsure of the cause


That wouldn't make sense since the folder the \_controller.pyd file resides in is Webots/lib/python37


Could be it's compiled in 2.7


I have been reading that this error comes up when the dll is compiled in a different python version to the one you're using

##### Hayden Woodger 11/15/2019 00:50:00
i had to go back to python 2.7


I had the same issue, didn't find a solution so

##### RossBatten 11/15/2019 00:49:38
?


Does this mean the file was found but the module contained was unable to be read?  Or does it mean the dll couldn't be found


ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.


Both files are in the source root directory: C:\Program Files\Webots\lib\python37


Any help I can get would be much appreciated


For reference, I'm using anaconda python 3.7.5 in windows


From what I can see, the \_controller.pyd file is in the same directory as the controller.py file so how is it able to find one but not the other?


I'm having trouble getting pycharm to work with webots, getting an error that it can't find \_controller that gets imported in the controller.py script

Yes, Webots relies on VRML97, it's a good way to import something in Webots.

##### Hayden Woodger 11/13/2019 14:50:00
I'm sure there's a very good reason why


Why not something more recent like stl, model, etc..


Seems like you can only import VRML97??

Hi, 



We try to walk op3 at webots. We are changing the codes of op2.



Is it important EEPROM Area for using op3 at simulation. they are different from op2. We did not changed them.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 08:18:39
Thank you for the bug report.


Yes, certainly. But this does not explain the crash. I would be on a bad memory management somewhere. But we should be able reproduce it in order to fix it.

##### machinekoder 11/12/2019 08:15:50
Okay I will. My guess is that has something to do with the amount of published "layer" laser scan topics, since reducing the layers fixes the issue

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 08:14:27
It would be much simpler to track this issue which seems to be a bug in our ROS controller..


With info about your system (Webots version, OS version, etc.)?


[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues)


Could I ask you to fill a bug report here:


To have a stack on linux, probably that the ROS controller should be build in debug mode... It begins to be too difficult to solve here.


Your GPU should work well with Webots.

I haven't tested un-synchronizing the controller on that yet though. I will sometime today and upload the results üôÇ

##### machinekoder 11/12/2019 08:05:52
`@Fabien Rohrer` I assumed the same, but the RangeFinder doesn't give me PointCloud. So the Lidar device seems to be the better fit.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 08:05:40
On the other hand, I have not a lot experiment in other libraries than ikpy


Yes, IK is for sure a slow task.

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 08:04:31
I have applied the inverse kinematics to each arm and leg of Atlas. When I try and run the simulation, whilst telling the arms and legs to go to new x,y,z position, it dramatically slows down the simulation.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/12/2019 08:01:59
Good point


> f you don't synconize the controller it'll go fast.


Yes, it was slowing down the ABB simulation, I had to reduce the controller rate to be able to run in real time. It's not very annoying in such demo, but I dreamed to use it to control the legs of a spider robot, and in this case, I think it's too slow üò¶

##### Hayden Woodger 11/12/2019 07:58:45
If you don't synconize the controller it'll go fast.


Do you think so?

Yes, we use to use this way to simulate kinect cameras for example.

Unless you reach a limitation with your GPU.


That said, there is no reason that the ROS controller crashes when increasing the number of layers.

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#range\_finder-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#range_finder-wbt)


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that using a Webots RangeFinder would be closer than a Webots Lidar node to simulate a 3D/ToF camera:


`@machinekoder` Hi,

##### machinekoder 11/12/2019 07:01:38
I've shared the sim here: [https://wolke.roessler.systems/s/q3Map9kMnPxwYA6](https://wolke.roessler.systems/s/q3Map9kMnPxwYA6)


I would like to simulate a 3D/ToF camera. For this purpose I've set up a sim with with a Lidar device. The ToF cam has a resolution of 224x171 and FOV of 62x45deg, I've entered that in Webots. So far so good.



When I now try to use the sim with a `ros` controller, the controller just crashes. I supect that this is due to the high layer resolutions, since it doesn't crash when I reduce the layers. 



Any ideas how to resolve this?

To include them into the ros workspace you just have to copy the msg and srv folders into the catkin workspace.


if you copy the include folder in your controller folder, then they should be built automatically (even if probably you won't need all of them)

##### threeal 11/11/2019 16:14:12

It also contains a sample of the CMakeLists.txt file that you could adapt to write your simple ros example in cpp. 

Other instructions for the standard ROS controller in cpp that you could need are described here [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#standard-ros-controller)

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:23:49
Sure!


But, in my tests, rover was teleoperated alone

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:23:41
`@Prasad` let's switch to a direct discussion üôÇ

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:23:31
Definitely yes.

##### threeal 11/11/2019 15:23:15
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` here [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:23:01
So, the first thing to determine is that: can you move the robot smoothly when the image processing is not used?


yes, I meant image processing.

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:21:08
Camera values as in? Image processing? Yes. I am using image processing to control motor speeds.

Camera values as in parameters like width and height? No. Those are fixed

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:20:24
Are the camera values used to control somehow the motor speeds?

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:19:24
Sometimes, the rover gets stuck also. Either the rover gets stuck or the camera flickers and goes gray in certain red regions


To some extent yes!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:18:42
If I understand well: when the basictimestep is modified, it affects the robot speed, right?

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:18:09
> Do you still have issues with this?



Yes


Yes

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:17:57
Do you still have issues with this?


The second topic is about the pioneer control, right?


Ok.

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:17:25
> So you're right telling that world parameters should not affect so much the simulation.



You are right! I meant that.



> Could we "close" this topic?



Sure!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:15:00
Is it satisfying? Could we "close" this topic?


So you're right telling that world parameters should not affect so much the simulation.


I added damping to render the controller more easy to write. It may indeed lose some physics accuracy doing so. For sure, in reality, their is some damping, but certainly not so big.


Ok, let's focus on this first.

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 15:06:34
And you are also right regarding several issues. I would help you with whatever info I can provide! Let me see if I can break that issue


Yes `@Fabien Rohrer`  I agree with you! However, as it is just PID controller, I believe, it will converge to the position without the need of world parameters like dampening etc. (I am deliberately avoiding too many parameters) + if I set `targetX` and `targetY` to -1.0 and -1.0, the quadcopter flies rock solid

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 15:00:20
respectfully üòâ


(I expect its normal to not have a perfect match, because the constants are hardcoded. The controller is not robust enough to support this. So setting the constants exactly as in mavic\_2\_pro.wbt should solve your issue.)


1. Is my answer about timestep and mavic satisfying?


Could we discuss of them one by one?


I'm sorry, but this issue is difficult to follow because it reports several issues at the same time.

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 14:54:15
That is great

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/11/2019 14:53:10
Hi, I just read your messages.

##### Prasad 11/11/2019 14:50:07
`@Fabien Rohrer` Regarding [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081) , shall we get on a call and close this one out? I am not able to replicate this consistently. However, I will be more than happy to just get it running properly with stability.

##### JFXian 11/11/2019 08:34:20
`@Stefania Pedrazzi`, thank you, i'll try

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/11/2019 08:22:54
Can you post the link to the sample tutorial for ros that you are referring to?

##### threeal 11/11/2019 08:20:53
thank you, i will try to use the supervisor features in the webots


`@Stefania Pedrazzi` the webots only provides a sample tutorial for creating ros controller in python, and not in c++, and i dont know how to link the webots library and ros library in catkin make

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/11/2019 08:18:34
You can enable the Supervisor functionality in a robot controller by setting the `Robot.supervisor` field to TRUE

##### threeal 11/11/2019 08:17:20
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` so how is the relation between supervisor and the robot? and does it still written in robot controller?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/11/2019 07:39:07
`@chamandana` please pay attention that the youBot omni wheels only work if the WorldInfo.contactProperties of the world are set correctly. You should open the default `youbot.wbt` world and copy them in your world.


`@threeal`: What do you mean exactly by "support for ros controller in c++"? You can already implement a ros controller as webots controller in c++ as we did when implementing the default ROS interface procided by Webots.


`@threeal`: to get the control PID values you can use the Supevisor API function to read the node field value. There is no Motor API function to retrieve it directly.


`@JFXian`: about closed kinematics loops, you can model them inserting a SolidReference node ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/solidreference)) in the joint endPoint field. This node is a reference to an existing Solid and allows you to reuse the same Solid node twice in the model.

For an example you can look at the `projects/samples/demows/worlds/stewart_platform.wbt` example ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-demos#stewart\_platform-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-demos#stewart_platform-wbt))

Sorry if I am wrong


So I think you can try to code with that and see what does it says and than fix that


Well, I am not good in roscpp but just going through the ros folder provided by Webots also includes roscpp as well.

##### threeal 11/10/2019 10:58:10
i mean the custom ros controller, not the ros controller that been provided by webots

##### Tahir [Moderator] 11/10/2019 10:41:21
ROS controller is written in C++. Its upon you how you handle your program on ROS side. From Webots everything is available in the form of Services, now its upon you how you handle it wither in Python or C++.

##### threeal 11/10/2019 09:23:16
i have been able to create ros controller in webots using python. when will there be  a support for ros controller using c++? as i think it would be faster using that.

##### Hayden Woodger 11/09/2019 22:35:49
You can get the velocity and position though.


Sorry you are right, my mistake.

In connection with [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/1081) , could anyone let me know any tips as to how I can fix it for now?


The rover is getting stuck and I am not able to get the simulation of both quadcopter and rover working. I guess I will raise a bug report for now

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 13:47:41
It's normal to observe a small difference in the simulation result when you change the basic time step. If that difference is big when changing only moderately the time step, then it is certainly worth a bug report.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 13:45:42
Should I raise a bug report on that?


For basicTimeStep 8, rover physics is behaving differently
> **Attachment**: [Untitled.mp4](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/642359055498608640/Untitled.mp4)


Ok. I guess the world has 32. That is why I was getting that error. Awesome. Thanks!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 11:30:41
Eg., if you WorldInfo.basicTimeStep is 8 ms, your controllers may have a control time step of 8, 16, 24, 32, etc.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 11:30:35
Oh ok! I will check that out

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 11:30:11
Beware however that the control step should be multiple of the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 11:29:55
Oh ok. Let me try that!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/08/2019 11:29:44
No, you can use different control step for different robots, this is not a problem.

##### Prasad 11/08/2019 11:28:55
Question here is should I set the same time step for both quadcopter and rover? What about communication sync?


If I set the TIME\_STEP too large like 64, rover works properly. But, quadcopter flips due to PID update rate. If I set TIME\_STEP to 4 or 8, quadcopter works. But, rover fails to follow the line


Thank you `@Olivier Michel` I was able to integrate communication. I was doing GPS based object tracking. However, I am facing one issue with ODE Physics engine. I keep getting the following warning.



WARNING: The current physics step could not be computed correctly. Your world may be too complex. If this problem persists, try simplifying your bounding object(s), reducing the number of joints, or reducing WorldInfo.basicTimeStep.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/07/2019 10:37:21
By the way..


In theory, the C controller can be translated to Python, there is a one-to-one match. So I guess you missed some point.

Thanks `@Fabien Rohrer` üôÇ I translated mavic2pro.c .However, the quadcopter was flipping and I couldn't work with it. That is when I studied and introduced control systems.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 11/07/2019 09:05:34

##### juanluciano 11/05/2019 22:37:54
It fails when I try to connect to the robot remotely, everything is fine in the simulation

##### Hayden Woodger 11/05/2019 22:36:21
Or just in the simulation?


This might sound dumb. Are you trying to remotely connect to a darwin robot in real life?


Was about to test it


Yeah the code looks fine to me.

##### juanluciano 11/05/2019 22:34:45
but I don't think the code is the cause of the failure  because I get the same errors with the exemplary controllers.

yes of course


I think so, since the errors appear with both the programs and the ones I have made

##### Hayden Woodger 11/05/2019 22:28:32
Could you send me the code you're using on your robot? I'll take a look and see if i can help.


I think it's saying your first error that the sleep() command can't be found. Have you imported  the correct libraries?

##### juanluciano 11/05/2019 22:24:28
I've only tried the 2019 version

##### Hayden Woodger 11/05/2019 22:23:13
*versions


Unistall and re-install with all the latest version?

##### juanluciano 11/05/2019 22:20:20
yes

i need help. 



When I try to do cross compilation or remote control with any controller in the last version of webots, whether with some example of the Darwin robot or some controller that I have programmed, I have many errors. I get the following code when I try to remotely control the robot.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/05/2019 11:16:06
- set the Lidar `tiltAngle` to 0 (this is know to cause issues, see: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/37](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/37) )

  - set the Lidar `spherical` to TRUE

  - decrease the WorldInfo.timeStep to 8


From your world file, I would recommend to:

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/05/2019 11:12:08
`@mkjhnb` for rotating lidar it is recomended to either set a slow rotation frequency either have a small simulation time step.

##### mkjhnb 11/05/2019 11:06:31
I wanted to use the ready model VelodyneHDL-32, but it seemed have some problems.

sorry, I mean that the value of the maxRange is so big, but the laser can't seem to touch the black wall, it seem very short. Why?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/05/2019 10:31:38
`@mkjhnb` the displayed range (cyan lines) corresponds to the value of the `Lidar.maxRange` field. Is this not the case for you?

So if you want to reduce the range you should change the `Lidar.maxRange` value

##### mkjhnb 11/05/2019 10:21:10
the range of this lidar is very big, why the result like this

In that case you can use simply the 'sleep' function for example: [https://linux.die.net/man/3/sleep](https://linux.die.net/man/3/sleep)

I was only able to get it working in a C code controller.  At least I can move ahead with it


`@Olivier Michel`  I don't understand what's going on then.  I've tried running the same controller now on two different PCs, one windows 10, one linux, visual studio and webots internal editor/cmake builder and the same crash occurs every time.  If I omit the label line it works fine but if I include it or any other supervisor controller command it crashes the whole of webots on play.

The way you get the motor is wrong, you have to get them like this:

```
epuckMotor = robot.getMotor()
```

##### HE110 11/04/2019 11:38:56
Can u give me a example?

How can I use Motor in controller programming with python?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 10:10:28
I did the same from Visual Studio 2019 and it worked as well.


`@RossBatten`: I could test your code from the Webots IDE on Windows 10 and it works as expected. I had to comment out the `lds[i] -> enable(timeStep);` line because the sensors were not found in my test world and this line was crashing the controller, but once that was commented out, everything was working as expected and I could see the "Hello" string displayed in the 3D view.

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 08:03:19
OK no problem.  I probably won't be able to get back to this until tomorrow.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 08:02:41
Thanks, I will inspect your code and try to reproduce the problem. I have a meeting now, so, I will get back to you after that.

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 08:00:12
I just copied and pasted the code into a webots editor controller and the same thing happened.  Spinning circle crash

I didn't, no

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:56:25
BTW, did you try to compile your code from the Webots built-in editor?


Yes, just copy/paste it on a gitst and that will be fine.

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:55:37

I do but I haven't got my source code versioned anywhere yet because I only just started it

Sure, what's the best way to do that here?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:53:53
Can you share the source code of your controller?

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:53:21
`@Olivier Michel`


If it's set to false I get an actual error message.  In this case it's simply freezing and I have to restart webots


Yes it does

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:52:36
`@RossBatten`: Can you check that your `Robot` node has the `supervisor` field set to `TRUE`?

`@smg` can you try to remove the cache of fontconfig:

```

##### RossBatten 11/04/2019 07:46:14
I have the robot set to have supervisor status


I'm building the controller in visual studio with no errors


Hi, I'm struggling with getting any kind of supervisor controller functionality working in my world.  If I remove the normal supervisor features and treat the controller as a simple robot only declaring it as a supervisor it works fine but the moment I try to use something as simple as setLabel(...) the simulation freezes and I get a spinning wheel and have to restart.  Any idea what's going on?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/04/2019 07:19:54
`@Xiangxiao` in case of the `floating_geometry.wbt` I think that the water animation speed was empirically on and not using a precise formula.

If you want that when you change the fluid properties also the animation speed changes I would suggest you to use a Robot with supervisor capabilities (`Robot.supervisor` field set to TRUE) so that in the controller you can read the `Fluid` properties and use them to compute the animation speed.


Alternatively instead of modifying the Nao PROTO node, you can also convert it to base nodes (right-click on the Nao node in the scene tree and choose "Convert to Base Node(s)") and then change the Robot.window field.


1. right-click on the Nao node in the scene tree and choose the "View PROTO source" item in the context menu;

2. add the line `window "generic_window"` at line 67 just after the `Robot {`

3. save the Nao.proto file in the "protos" folder in your project folder (see the description of the structure of the Webots project folder [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project))


`@Alexx` has I wrote in the previous message, the "window" field is not exposed in the Nao PROTO (see PROTO description [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)). So you have to:

`@Stefania Pedrazzi`


where can i find the Robot.window field to change the "generic" to "generic\_window"? when i double click on robot it appears a window with name "Generic robot window". In this window there are all the tabs expect motion editor

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 11/03/2019 12:43:38
`@smg` I coudl successfully install and run Webots on archlinux with Gnome desktop environemnt. Which (if any) desktop environment are you using?


Note that the "window" field is not exposed for the Nao PROTO, i.e. you have to modify the Nao.proto file.


In Webots R2019b is still possible to use the old Qt robot window (deprecated) which contains the MotionEditor by changing the Robot.window field from the default value "generic" to "generic\_window"


hi `@HiguchiNakamura` and `@Alexx` , the motion editor is currently not available with the new HTML window.

Thanks in advance


Hello, I am doing simulation of fish-like robot swimming in fluid water. I am doing the fluid water based on the sample of Webots (floating\_geometries.wbt). In the sample, the water flow contains two components, including the DEF FLOWING\_WATER fluid (defining the physics of water flow) and DEF WATER\_FLOWING\_ANIMATION robot (defining the visual behavior/animation of water flow). In FLOWING\_WATER fluid, I can define the velocity of water flow. In the controller of WATER\_FLOWING\_ANIMATION robot, I can define the speed of the animation that simulate the water flow. I would like to know that how can I induce [the parameter of velocity of physical water flow in FLOWING\_WATER fluid] into [the controller of WATER\_FLOWING\_ANIMATION robot]? I want to do this since I would like to correlate the physical velocity of water flow to the playing-speed of animation.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 16:38:54
By the way, you should probably have a look at the 'custom\_robot\_window.wbt' world which is a very simple example of custom robot window.


I juste tried and it seems to work fine.


If I am not wrong they are supposed to be displayed in the Webots Console

##### JoanGerard 11/01/2019 16:33:57
an other question, is there any way of watching to the console.log printed messages when using a robot window?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 16:30:43
Yes exactly this is just if you want to 'inherit' from the default robot window, but you can of course create your own custom robot-window without using this function.

##### JoanGerard 11/01/2019 16:25:49
This function configures the robot window only right? I think that I may need it in the future but for the moment it's ok

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 11/01/2019 16:20:46
Unforunately it seems the 'wbu\_default\_robot\_window\_*' functions are not  available in other languages than C, but it should be possible to add them, would you be interested in doing this ?


Let me check

##### JoanGerard 11/01/2019 16:17:19

You can also select your robot and go to the View menu of Webots to select either "Follow Object" or "Follow Object and Rotate". You will quickly understand the difference by trying both options.


Yes, select your robot and hit F5.

They should not. Maybe you can use the robot-window to see in real time the value of the GPS (just double click on your truck to open it).


The noise of the GPS can be defined with it's 'accuracy' field ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps)), can you please confirm this field is set to 0 ?

##### JoHn 10/31/2019 14:55:24
I am just guessing, would the two GPS be conflict with each other?


The GPS signals I got were varying within 10m. I guess the noise would not be that much, right?  And when I turned off one of the GPS, the simulation worked very good.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/31/2019 14:48:20

Hi `@JoanGerard`

##### JoanGerard 10/31/2019 14:22:25
Hello, I am trying to make a web animation and I would like to see an example online. Webots documentation suggests this site-> [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/) but it's not working for me. I cannot enter into any simulation at all. For instance, this site [https://robotbenchmark.net/](https://robotbenchmark.net/)benchmark/viewpoint\_control/simulation.php is a blank page. Do you know if there are any other sites similar to that one where I can find an example?

This is done for example in the 'display' sample, see for example: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/samples/devices/controllers/display/display.c#L111](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/samples/devices/controllers/display/display.c#L111)


Yes of course, you can draw a rectangle with the same size than the e-puck with 'wb\_display\_fill\_rectangle' ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb\_display\_fill\_rectangle](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb_display_fill_rectangle))

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 13:25:40
I'm pretty sure a good tradeoff can be found, because this layout is used in real robots.


For example, if the spring/damping are too low the robot cannot climp the box, if they are too big, they cannot retract quickly enough (as shown here).


The point is about to find good physics properties to let this work smoothly.


This kind of issues is due the robot layout. I would bet that the same occurs on a real robot üòÑ

=> you're right about the bois <=> caoutchouc, it's set to -1. this is not a good idea üôÇ


or to increase the Motor.maxTorque (I didn't test this)


you could either increase the friction (I set the ContactProperties.coulmbFriction to 10 between caoutchouc and sol, and it is working)


the motors are not powerful enough to climb the stairs.

##### Oxygenious 10/30/2019 12:51:31
I suppose that there is a problem between "bois" and "caoutchouc", they are not always in contact like it would be in real life.


Ah okay, so i fixed the typo but the robot still cannot climb the stairs.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 12:47:41
Yes, it's the case. My comment is just about how to remove the annoying warnings appearing in the Webots console (I looked at them first).

##### Oxygenious 10/30/2019 12:46:52
when we fix the mass , shouldn't the density be ignored?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 12:45:05
By the way, you have also several not-related warnings about density. You can fix them by changing these fields: Physics.density=-1 for each Physics node where you defined the Physics.mass


Once fixing this, the friction acts as expected.


"caoutchou" => "caoutchouc" üòÅ


there is a typo in ContactProperties


It seems you defined well the contact properties between "sol" and "caoutchou"


Ok, I have your simulation running on my computer.

Are you interested on modeling a satellite in Webots? This is definitively something I would like to see üôÇ


Ok I see, this sounds good then.

##### Gautier A. 10/30/2019 08:36:15
It's a reaction wheel used on satellite, it doesn't neccesitate a lot of torque.


It's more because of the caracteristic of the wheel itself. The torque is very low in the "datasheet" of the constructor

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 08:24:23
Indeed, the PID control we provide does not propose an anti-windup. But in theory, this could be implemented in the controller. I'm wondering why you get this saturation? Did you play with the maxTorque field? Normally this field should allow you to increase the motor torque.

##### Gautier A. 10/30/2019 08:17:52
I've already tried some little experiments with rotationnal motors and position sensor (using hinge joint)  and it seemed to be working, but to be honest, what worries me a little is the  abscence of anti-windup in this configuration (because the torque "saturate" at 5mNm, the PID is gonna integrate the error caused by the saturation)


Yes, thank you a lot !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/30/2019 08:15:53
Is it a satisfying answer?


but the algorithm should be written by yourself.


So I confirm Webots allows to set the input and retrieve the output of the algorithm you mention.


You could have the actual speed of the motor thanks to a PositionSensor (you should just derive the position along the time once to get the speed).


I expect that controlling a (or several) rotational motor(s) in torque control is a good starting point.


That said, we don't have examples of such setup.


I could first confirm that it's certainly possible to model a reaction wheel in Webots, indeed, the physics engine supports momentum reactions.

I can't say which axis is which one, you probably want to print the value of all the 6 axes and then move them one by one to identify which one is which one.

##### JoHn 10/29/2019 17:06:05
Hi `@David Mansolino`, my joystick has 6 axis. Does it mean that each stick on the joystick has 2 axis? And are the axis numbering from 0 to 5? For example, if I only use one stick (marked in the red circle) on the left side of the joystick to control both steering and speed (throttle and brake), I should subscribe the topics of /joystick/axis0 and /joystick/axis1, is this correct?

You can find some example here: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations)


The ros controller is just the interface between ros and Webots, you should create the behavior in the ros node.

##### threeal 10/29/2019 10:45:44
and how is the relation between both of them?

You can monitor the overall mass (the sum of all the solids) by selecting the robot, and check the mass tab under the scene tree.


The Robot node derives the Solid node.


No, the physics node of the robot should only take into account the mass of its associated bounding object.


hi

##### Oxygenious 10/29/2019 09:25:10
Hi everyone, 

I have a question about the physics node. For example, if we design a robot with multiple hinge joints and hence multiple endsolids with defined physics node(weights and center of mass), does the robot's physics node have to  include all the weights of all its parts?

Thanks in advance

##### Gautier A. 10/29/2019 08:54:14
But, what I mean is that the "upper parent" parents is going to have its own boundingbox/masses, which will be the sum of the information in its own physics node, and its children physics node ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 08:49:30
> does that mean that the upper (most high parent in the node hiearchy) retains all the information of mass and bounding box of all its children solid ?



No each solid should have it's own mass and boundign box informations, then they masses and bounding boxes are just merged together.

##### Gautier A. 10/29/2019 08:45:08
(Do you have any more reference on how the physics engine works and merge the bounding box / the masse of the differents solid ?)


Concerning the implicit solid merging indicated on that page ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics)), does that mean that the upper (most high parent in the node hiearchy) retains all the information of mass and bounding box of all its children solid ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/29/2019 07:25:23
`@Gordon`, unfortunately, only `sensor_msgs::LaserScan` and `sensor_msgs::PointCloud` are supported yet. However, you should be able to change/extend this quite easily. The publication fo the `sensor_msgs::PointCloud` is done here: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosLidar.cpp#L121](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/RosLidar.cpp#L121)

In this function you should be able to extend to `sensor_msgs::PointCloud2` and then you have to recompile the `ros` controller (let me know if you have any issue doing so).

##### Gordon 10/29/2019 07:12:51
Is there any method publishing sensor\_msgs::PointCloud2? instead of PointCloud?


`@David Mansolino` I have got errors which is with Rviz crashing the when it try to read Pointcloud topic which was created from Webot\_ros. It seems to be with "ros Assertion `(min.x <= max.x && min.y <= max.y && min.z <= max.z) && "The minimum corner of the box must be less than or equal to maximum corner"' failed."

I suspect this is due to some erroneous point cloud, I can see 11MB/s of point clouds are created at 32 Hz. but some or all may have some errorneous points which crashes Rviz.

Is there any method to validate or fix point cloud from webots side?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/28/2019 20:14:27
and connection of nodes you can check by rqt\_graph


you can check it with rosnode list, rosservice list etc.


You can check here in the world file protos are the same with different naming arguments so everything changes accordingly

By changing the robot name the all ros names are appended by robot name


`@threeal`  when you change the robot name and add corresponding arguments in the controller args field then every information changes from rosnodes, topics and list.

##### threeal 10/28/2019 19:57:38
and in the e-puck sample, i tried to change the robot name, it changes the topic name of the robot, but the rosnode that control the robot could still able to send a message to webots simulator even if it has different topic name. how could it happens?


and how do i know if i subsribe a message from one robot and not the other?

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/28/2019 17:34:35
`@threeal` Yes, different robots are treated sepreately, They will have all the information in different ros services (namespaced by the robots name you specify)

##### threeal 10/28/2019 17:30:24
when a world has 2 robots, does it treats each robot as separate node when using ros controllers?

If you select any Robot/Solid node in the scene-tree you can then go to the node editor in the 'mass' field ans select 'including descendants', it will then compute the total mass of the robot/solid with all of its descendants:

##### Gautier A. 10/28/2019 13:44:27
How can you check the total weight of a robot ? I was pretty sure I changed the mass on all the field of the Puma


For the problem of the three robots, well, it's because I want to see how it would behaves if two "concurrent robot" with each one having its own controller would behave. It's for a project of a simulator, where mesh would be simulated as robot to simulate very little deformation of their mesh (and IndexFaceSet) for exemple


Thank you !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/28/2019 13:35:06
Additionnally, the total mass of the pioneer is 42.3kg and of the puma 27.4, therefore the difference is not so big


the pioneer should be the rrot robot and the puma a direct children of the pioneer.


I don't understand qhy you have 3 robots in your hierarchy.


Let me check quiclky your simulation files

##### Gautier A. 10/28/2019 13:30:23
Or did a make a mistake somewhere else ?


Yes, I agree. But because I set a masse of the pionner 500x time superior than the masses of the Puma, the Puma should have a negligible impact, shouldn't it ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/28/2019 13:29:02
What you are changing there, is the center mass of the base segment of the robot, but all the children segment still have their center of mass up.

Basically, i have to take the inertia matrix of the pionneer as something along -6m on the y axis for it to work properly


So, I modified as you said. But there's still a thing I can't understand. The robot to behaves likes the "puma arm" was very heavy, when I explicitely defined all the masses as 0.1kg (and the mass of the pioneer of something like 50kg). It's especially wired when it seems that the change of direction of the Puma seems to impact the inertia force of the "whole robot" (which is good and excepted !)

The behavior is indeed not the expected one!

Are you shure all your Solid/robot nodes in the hierarchy have both a bounding object and a physics defined?

##### Gautier A. 10/28/2019 12:58:56
What I would like to do, to put it in a nutshell, is see if I can use a robot for "moving", and another robot for "sensor" or manipulation, with each one having seperate controllers


I tried to run a puma robotic arm on a pioner, but even when the puma doesn't have any controller, a part of the robot "glitches" and there is some kind of offset between its links

##### Gordon 10/24/2019 23:25:48
`@David Mansolino`  Thanks for your reply, I have used Pioneer 3AT example, and I could see all topics in RVIZ and RQT topic monitor on Host computer, However, remote computer RVIZ did not pick up any tf related topics. Rqt topic monitor on remote shows tf related topics. Therefore, there are something with Rviz on Remote.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/24/2019 07:25:15
`@Gordon`, have you tried the 'Pioneer 3 AT' webots-ros sample that use tf just to check if it works fine with your setup: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations#Simulation\_Pionneer\_3\_AT](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations#Simulation_Pionneer_3_AT)  ?

##### Gordon 10/24/2019 07:21:04
I have some issues with RVIZ for not able to use tf data from webots\_ros on a remote machine. Is there anyone experiencing such problem? I can get most of the topics diaplayed to rviz, not tf. I can see tf comes by topic monitoring tools from rqt.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/24/2019 06:32:20
`@Gordon`, if you want to use a Lidar model that is not already available in Webots, you should use the default Lidar node and then set the fields of this node to matches the specification of the sick MRS6****: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar)

     Node1{}

if fields.numberofNodes.value > 1 then

    Node2{}

end

if fields.numberofNodes.value > 2 then

    Node3{}

> if i want use another way except file what way you suggest?



I am not an expert in Matlab, but you should check what is the simplest to implemetn in Matlab between pipes and TCPIP communication.


If you are in real\_time mode then Webots will try to match as much as possible the amount time\_step to the real time.

##### fateme 10/23/2019 07:45:11
the amount of time\_step in wb\_robot\_step(time\_step) is effective in run time?


if i want use another way except file what way you suggest?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:42:56
In that case that's probably the way to go for better performances.

##### fateme 10/23/2019 07:41:14
no

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:40:51
Ok, in that case you may need other way to communicate between Webots and Matlab than files (which are indeed quite slow). Have you tried using TCPIP for example? Or pipes?

##### fateme 10/23/2019 07:39:47
because i use toolbox of matlab

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:39:06
Ok, then why aren't you using directly a Matlab controller?

##### fateme 10/23/2019 07:38:46
no one in webots and another in matlab app

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/23/2019 07:38:24

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/21/2019 07:00:52
`@dulla`: Yes, Webots is a useful tool to design your own robot in simulation, program it and see how it will interact with its environment.


`@Marcey`: The appearance of objects (color, reflections, etc.) has no impact on the Lidar measurements. The Lidar only uses depth of field to compute its return values (based on the OpenGL depth buffer, also called Z buffer), in addition to the optional noise value.

##### dulla 10/20/2019 23:48:03

like it shows which parts you need to assemble the robot

But there are probably other solution to make your simulation faster, have you read this page: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/speed-performance) ?


Note also that 256 is already a quite big value, usign higher values may make your simulation unstable/unprecise.


Hi `@jhielson`, unfortunately no, the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep shouldn't bee bigger than your controller tiem step.

##### jhielson 10/18/2019 15:31:48
Hi, I am trying to improve the speed of my simulation in order to reduce the training time of my model.  I saw that I can increase the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep value but can it be greater than my current wb\_robot\_step.

Tried different port. same result

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 07:19:36
one thing you could also try is to test a different port


Webots writes errors to the stderr/stdout and in the Webots console


the streaming server writes logs by default in the <webots>/resources/web/server/log folder. But here the problem seem to come from Webots itself

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 07:17:59
no logs in /var/log


does the streaming server write any logs ?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 07:14:29
yes

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 07:13:28

so you ran the same command and you can access the texture files?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 06:56:32
I just tested on revision and it works just fine on my machine


if it doesn't then you should inspect if Webots prints any error message (in the Webots console or in the terminal)


on localhost:2001 it is normal that doesn't find anything, but for example this URL should work http://localhost:2001/textures/conveyor\_belt\_rubber.jpg

##### Choomah 10/15/2019 06:49:36
brb


Gives empty response on localhost:2001


/root/webots/webots --batch --mode=pause --minimize --no-sandbox --stdout --stderr --stream=port=2001;monitorActivity;controllerEdit /root/webots/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/robot\_programming/worlds/robot\_programming.wbt


cache is cleared I will restart the computer just to be sure

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/15/2019 06:43:58
Did you clear the cache?

to debug this you should inspect what does the Webots instance. First step would be to simply start webots with the `--stream` option and try to connect to the texture (with default port at http://localhost:1234/textures/<texture path>)

`@Mehran Raisi` about the PR2 Webots model: instead of using the data from the PROTO file you could

1. convert it to base nodes: right click on the PR2 item in the scene tree and "Convert to base node(s)"

2. if you select a Solid or device node, then you can get the absolute or relative position of the part in the "Position" tab of the field editor (just below the scene tree)


`@Choomah` 

1. did you try to connect directly to the textures URL? does it work?

2. what happens exactly when you click on the play button? and the step button?

I would suggest you to clear the browser cache, this helps sometimes

yes, but you have to replace `<robot_unique_name>` by something else (a name that you choose and that is different for each vehicle)

##### JoHn 10/14/2019 15:31:30
Thank you `@David Mansolino`. Is this a correct way to add the argument?

`@Willem3141`, you're welcome. If you want you can re-ask the question on Wednesday, one of me colleague which is way more aware of the debugging mechanism of the robot-window will be connected.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:12:31
`@Choomah` Cool! thank you for the link! I will check to add this to the documentation

##### Willem3141 10/14/2019 15:11:32
`@David Mansolino` Thanks for the help so far. I think I'll give up on this for today, let's see if I can fix things another day üôÇ


`--remote-debugging-port=...` behaves the same as setting `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING`, that is: you get a list with inspectable pages (in my case: the robot window and a user guide viewer), but clicking on either of these just results in a blank window. Webots returns an empty HTTP response üòï

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 15:10:05

You probably want to add the `--name=<robot_unique_name>.` argument to both controller with different unique\_names to have always the exact same services/topics names: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller)

##### JoHn 10/14/2019 15:05:52
Thank you `@David Mansolino` for your answer. I tried to control two vehicles in a single ROS node. However, sometimes only one vehicle moved or both vehicles did not move. I am not sure what mistake I made. I am guessing the problem may come from the 'controllername'. Would you give me some advice?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 15:01:41
about `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING` you should actually be able to start Webots with the `--remote-debugging-port=....` port. See this link for more information: [https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-debugging.html](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebengine-debugging.html)


`@Willem3141` oh yes you are completely right `QtWebKitWidgets` is valid on windows only


`@JoHn`, as you prefeer you can either control on vehicle by node either control several vehicles from the same node (in that case you have to call the corresponding services for each vehicles)

##### JoHn 10/14/2019 14:56:55
Hey guys, now I am able to control one vehicle via a ROS node. My question is, is it possible to control multiple vehicles via ROS at the same time? Should each vehicle have one ROS node to control it? Thank you very much for your help.

##### Willem3141 10/14/2019 14:56:29
Anyone has any experience with `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING`?


`@David Mansolino` Unfortunately I can't get Webots to compile on Linux with the inspector code enabled, because `<QtWebKitWidgets/QWebInspector>` cannot be found (my understanding is that Webots uses `QtWebEngine` instead of `QtWebKit` on Linux). I then found out that you can set `QTWEBENGINE_REMOTE_DEBUGGING` to some port number, and open `http://localhost:<port>` in Chrome to do remote debugging. Unfortunately this doesn't work either: after choosing the page to inspect, it only results in a blank page üò¶

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 14:32:31
I have a very simple machine


Docker has become useless, which I guess is due to the 10 webots servers running in the background


I think something good happened

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 14:24:46
I never got these ones... if you check in the `<webots>/resources/web/server/log/simulation/output.log` file you can get the exact instruction that is run by the simulation server. Did you try to run Webots directly and see if it works?

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 14:22:37
etc...

I commented the DISPLAY line out


Ah that worked semi ^\_^


I am running it headless in a docker container

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 14:20:09
this is needed to run on a headless server machine, but for example on my system with dual screen this instruction doesn't work


you can try to comment line `os.environ["DISPLAY"] = ":0"` (about line 702) in simulation\_server.py

##### Choomah 10/14/2019 14:18:25

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 14:18:04
`@Choomah` the error about `The console states: WebSocket error: Unknown message received: "x3d;broadcast"` is probably because the Webots version and the `webots.min.js` version are not matching

Because the hingejoint node need a lot of sources of computer, however, we want simulate with about 49 robots. So we need simplify the robot's model.


`@Olivier Michel`  The axis does not pass through the origin of the robot


If the Supervisor robot rotates around a defined axis parallel to the Y-axis and does not apply the differential drive method, how should the rotation parameters of the Supervisor node be set?


I want let a cylinder supervisor rotation with a axis parallel to y axis and do not use hingejoint node,  how can I set supervisor rotation parameters?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 13:33:59
... not sure to understand what you want to achieve...

##### John0911 10/14/2019 13:33:22
And this axis is parallel to y axis.


If a cylinder shape robot rotation with a defined axis but not y axis, how can I achieve this?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 13:10:21
This page can help you to define the rotation axis in VRML format: [https://cyberbotics.com/rotation\_tool](https://cyberbotics.com/rotation_tool)


Sure, you can define whatever rotation axis you need.

##### John0911 10/14/2019 13:05:31
`@Olivier Michel` I have known the supervisor can rotation with one axis. However, I want to know whether the supervisor  can rotation with a defined axis.

Hi all!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/14/2019 06:13:37
`@Lars`: it's great that you found the problem. We are going to investigate this resolution problem to see whether you uncovered a bug... I will be back about it.


`@SimonDK`: it's not possible to select multiple objects in the scene tree. Not sure what you mean by mirroring a component... It is indeed possible to set a negative Transform.scale parameter to somewhat mirror a shape. Is that what you meant?


`@JoHn`: what you want to do is possible. I see no problem doing that. Did you try to do it? Did you experienced any problem?


`@ClLebi`: yes, this is possible, you will have to program it from a physics plugin, detect the collision, then remove it, so that it won't be taken into account by the physics engine.

##### SimonDK 10/12/2019 18:14:11
Can I mirror a component?

##### Lars 10/12/2019 12:47:19
`@Olivier Michel` Since yesterday I worked on some changes for the position sensor that did not resolve my issue. Then it occurred to me that it was perhaps not the controller or my code that was at fault, but rather something with the device(s). Then I stripped everything away to see what might be the problem. And apparently it was because I had put a value in the resolution field, when I changed it to -1 (default value) I was able to read the position of all my sensors.

But this begs the question as to why I was unable to specify the resolution in the first place? According to the documentation in [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor) you can set the resolution to anything in the interval of 0 and infinity(-1). So what's the problem here?

You are right. It works on the default epuck project.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 14:01:30
Can you open the default e-puck world? In this one, you should be able to open the e-puck robot window and upload your HEX file.


That means the robot is not recognized as an e-puck robot... Did you change it?

##### jhielson 10/11/2019 13:59:33

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:44:09
Your PROTO should contain an IndedexFaceSet node for which you should compute the coordinates and assign them with the `%{=` statement.


It's the point list inside the PROTO that should be generated.


You should not change input fields, but rather change the coordinates values inside the PROTO.

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 12:30:24
Where did I made a mistake ?


The problem is that it "display" the change of value in the console, in lua. But it doesn't change the field values in itself, in webots


%{

        print('test')

        local i

        for i = 1,40,1

        do

            print("\n")

            print(fields.points.value[i]["x"])

            fields.points.value[i]["x"] = fields.points.value[i]["x"] + 10

            print("   ")

            print(fields.points.value[i]["x"])

        end

    }%


I've proceed as you suggested, with lua code, and defined the followings lines :


Well, your idea kind of works. I'm still stuck at "something" and I don't really know why it doesn't works


`@Olivier Michel`  Thank you for your response !

##### Lars 10/11/2019 12:17:12
Yeah that was my plan B if my current controller couldn't be salvaged. I have a simulation working that can read position sensor in Python. But it is not for my own robot. 

Anyway thanks so much for the help. üòÄ

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:15:03
At some point you may find the problem.


Then modify it step-by-step to get as close as possible as your own model.


write a python controller for it and check whether it works.


webots/projects/samples/devices/worlds/position\_sensor.wbt


I would recommend you to start from the provided example:


No, it shouldn't change anything.

##### Lars 10/11/2019 12:13:29
Will anything change if I put the robot into a proto file and use it?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:12:47

OK.

##### Lars 10/11/2019 12:11:44
Python.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:11:38
OK. Is you controller in C or C++?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 12:11:20
Same as the motors. `timeStep = int(4 * robot.getBasicTimeStep())`

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 12:10:54
At which frequency did you enabled the sensors?


Not sure...


Ok, that means the problem is in the sensors, not in the controller.

##### Lars 10/11/2019 12:07:55
`@Olivier Michel` Yeah I see change in the motors, but sensors stay at 0.

That contains some LUA code which recomputes the coordinates.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)


`@Gautier A.`: it should be a procedural proto.


`@Lars`: I mean the robot window. Double-click on the robot and the robot window should open, then you should see a tab with position sensors.

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 11:35:57
(here is my proto : [https://pastebin.com/WYnj7u2E](https://pastebin.com/WYnj7u2E) , I want to modify some of the "z" coordinate" of some points )

##### Lars 10/11/2019 11:35:51
`@Olivier Michel` Yes, when I run the program and command the first joint to move to 0.1 it changes as it should from 0 to 0.1, but sensor doesn't see the change.

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 11:34:55
`@Olivier Michel`  I think I see. So, for exemple, I can create a new value "coefficient" in my proto, and multiply the points in the field "coordinate" by that coefficient ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 11:33:56
When you open the robot window, can you see the position sensor values in the graphical user interface?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 11:32:42
`@Olivier Michel` Yeah all motors are moving as they should, that's why I'm so confused.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 11:31:45
Is the motor actually moving?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 11:30:42
`@Olivier Michel` It just continues to print 0 endlessly. Might there be a problem in the construction of the device(s)?

One of the leg joints with a rotational motor and sensor looks like this:

```DEF LEG-1-COXA HingeJoint {
      jointParameters HingeJointParameters {
        axis 0 0 1
        anchor 0.0716 0.12096 0
      }
      device [
        PositionSensor {
          name "c1_pos"
          resolution 4096
        }
        RotationalMotor {
          name "c1_ser"
          maxVelocity 1
          maxTorque 100
        }
      ]
```

I tried changing parameters such as resolution, but it didn't change the outcome.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 11:30:37
Do you see what I mean?


The field of the new PROTO should be used to recompute the coordinates. It could be for example the amplitude and frequency parameters of the wave and the procedural PROTO will recompute the coordinates according to these input fields.


No, that's not what was done in the demo PROTO.

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 11:25:18
If so, what should be the type of the corresponding field ? "Coord" I guess ?


So basically, If i want to test that out, I have to make a new proto, with the "points" of the coordinate as a field ?


`@Olivier Michel`  Ok, thank  you !

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 10:51:08
Would that work better?


```
while robot.step(timeStep) != 1:
    for i in range(len(psName)):
        value = ps[i].getValue()
        psValues.append(value)
    print(psValues)
```


That's normal, it prints the sensor values at step 0, so, it could be that all values are 0. You should put the print inside the loop and should not break the loop.

##### Lars 10/11/2019 10:19:16
Looks like this

```while robot.step(timeStep) != 1:
    for i in range(len(psName)):
        value = ps[i].getValue()
        psValues.append(value)
    break
print(psValues)
```

Prints all zeros in the list for all of my sensors.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 09:48:23
Are you sure you are calling the step function regularly before checking the sensor value?

##### Lars 10/11/2019 09:31:30
I can upload my own project if that would make it easier.


`@Olivier Michel` Yeah, the reason I am asking is because I took a simple example from [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/711#issuecomment-510832161](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/issues/711#issuecomment-510832161) and implemented the getValue() function to read the motion. But I can't do it for my own robot/code where I go through similar steps.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 09:22:14
`@Lars`: you should be able to read this information from any robot, no need for a supervisor. Are you sure your device tags are non-null and the corresponding devices are properly enabled? Do you get any warning in the Webots console?


`@Gautier A.`: I believe the demo you are mentioning (waves) was achieved about the same way, but instead of changing the coordinates directly, the supervisor changes some field of a procedural PROTO node which in turn will recompute its internal coordinate values accordingly. This might be faster than changing the coordinates directly, not sure.

##### Lars 10/11/2019 09:20:22
`@Olivier Michel` I've done that. I also implemented `while robot.step(timeStep) != -1:` to prevent it from reading sensor values before there are anything in there.

Is there anything preventing me from doing this using robot() rather than supervisor()?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/11/2019 09:17:54
[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab=python#wb\_position\_sensor\_enable](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/positionsensor?tab=python#wb_position_sensor_enable)


`@Lars`: you should enable the sensors so that you don't get the `nan` value any more.

##### Gautier A. 10/11/2019 07:38:15
(In another question, do you know how this demonstration/exemple has been done ? [https://youtu.be/OKxdaNqmQco](https://youtu.be/OKxdaNqmQco)  )


(Here is the C code [https://pastebin.com/wTBZk88e](https://pastebin.com/wTBZk88e) )


I want to simulate deformation on a mesh, I've used supervisor to change the points of an IndexFaceSet, but it's pretty slow.


Hello, Is there a way to change the geometry of an object using supervisor in a "fast way" ?

##### Lars 10/10/2019 13:57:39
`@David Mansolino` Since implementing the `getValue` function to obtain the motor position it just keeps reading `[nan]` at the start of the program or `[0]` after moving the motors into a new position. I didn't have these issues when I initially did the tutorials for distance sensor and neither when I replicated it again.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/10/2019 08:40:25
nevertheless you should be able to set the position of the joint, the same as you will do from the scene tree, using the snippet you posted


so if the Motor node is not part of the Supervisor model, you cannot control it from your supervisor controller


`@machinekoder` it is only possible to control a device from its Robot controller and using the device API

##### machinekoder 10/10/2019 07:54:30
Can I set the position of a Motor node from a supervisor controller? I was thinking about something along the lines of 

```
motor = robot.getFromDef(name)
position = motor.getField('position')
def set_position(target):
  position.setSFFloat(target)
```

Hi everyone, i'm new to webots and i'm trying to develop a quadcopter proto, simply with 1 body (solid with shape of a box), 4 propellers and 2 diagonals and i'm reading both from the propeller world file and mavic2pro proto.  however, although the 4 propellers seem to be working fine (with a controller as simple as setting velocity to the motors),  the quadcopter spins around itself whenever the velocities go high and never takes off the ground. What may be the possible issues with this? Thank you all so much.

Simply make a test in your control loop to check if the delay is over and call the function if this is the case.

How to invoke a delaying statement there?


I'm using python

Is there is a way to delay a function. Like delaying a funcition by 1000ms


Hi,

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/09/2019 06:35:06
`@jwanner`, yes this is feasible, for this you should do a PROTO.

If you are not familiar with PROTO, I strongly recommend to follow this tutorial: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-7-your-first-proto)

Then reading the chapter about PROTO: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)

In particular the sub-chapter about procedural PROTO that allows you to use a scripting language inside your PROTO definition: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/09/2019 06:23:45
Another option is to remove the graphical appearance of the Floor and keep only the physical one.


If you look at the `projects/vehicles/wrolds/city.wbt` simulation distributed within Webots, the translation.y value of the road elements is set to 0.02.


`@Muhsin Kompas` the visual issue you get is called z-fighting ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting)).

This happens because the road and the floor are coplanar and can be solved by slightly modifying the translation.y value of one of the two objects.


Adding dummy Robot instances as suggested by `@Tahir` should be avoided and it is useless.


`@Sohil` the Supervisor class inherits from Robot class, so you can call the `getTime()` function from the Supervisor instance.

##### jwanner 10/08/2019 20:25:55
Hi again ! Thank you for your help the other day, I was able to achieve what I wanted. But now I have another question, is it possible to have an automatic generation of nodes in Webots ? I have a robot with several rigid segments linked together with hinge/rotational motor, and for example I would like to say, my total length is 10cm and I want 5 segments and it would build the 5 rigid segments of 2cm each linked with rotational motor. I have no idea if it is feasible or if we just have to do it by hand each time, I am curious.

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/08/2019 20:22:58
`@Sohil` upto my knowledge,

Supervisor node is available only in Robot. So here in this case you can add a dummy Robot() from which you can enable the Supervisor and than can use this to get the simulation time.

Hi Mike, If you are speaking about the follow and rotate behavior of the viewpoint, the rotation will be the same as the object itself, the goal is to be able to as if you were the object

##### MIKE 10/08/2019 12:56:52
HiÔºÅDoes the supervisor\_rotation function allow a robot to rotate around a specified axis? Or is it only able to find its own center to rotate?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 09:33:14
You're right it's rqt (which is even more strange), but anyway computing it directly in the ros node is probably the simplest workaround.

From the webots\_ros/Float64Stamped ([http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots\_ros/html/msg/Float64Stamped.html](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots_ros/html/msg/Float64Stamped.html)) you can get the value (in the data field)  and the associate time (in the header.stamp field) you need then to keep the previous value and time and when you receive a new value you can compute the speed with: speed = (new\_value - old\_value) / (new\_time - old\_time)

##### Marcey 10/08/2019 09:09:46
the error is not from matlab, but from rqt ([http://wiki.ros.org/rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt)). Yeah, it probably is quite simple, if you know how to do it üòÖ.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 09:02:29
It seems the definition of the message (and therefore the md5sum) is different in Matlab üòï why using matlab? It should be quite simple to compute the position difference and divide it by the time difference directly in your ROS controller.

##### Marcey 10/08/2019 08:52:04
I have a follow up question to my question from yesterday. You recommended to use the PositionSensor and derivate it to get the speed. My idea was to record a rosbag of the "/<device\_name>/value"-topic (that worked) and use Matlab to derivate. But I cannot open the bag-File in Matlab and when I want to plot the bag in rqt, I get this error:



For type [webots\_ros/Float64Stamped] stored md5sum [e6c99c37e6f9fe98e071d524cc164e65] has invalid message definition."



Do you have any ideas on how to solve this or for another approach?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/08/2019 06:27:51
`@Muhsin Kompas` the objects falls because the road doesn't have any boundingObject (physics shape). To fix it you have to add a ground object, for example a Floor PROTO

`@Chirantha` Hello,

You can write your script both in webots amd external file. In case of Webots(which is preferable), you just need to specify the controller.

In case of an external file you need to specify 'extern' in controller field of the robot.

And about the library I would recommend you to go through webots tutorials. There you will find the necessary information and you'll get an idea how you can proceed in your project may be.

Hi `@Marcey`, you are completely right about the 'get\_velocity' service.

##### Marcey 10/07/2019 15:15:05
Hello guys, I am using Webots with ROS. I want to get the velocity of a wheel/RotationalMotor, to create a graph where I can compare the set velocity and the actual velocity and see how it changes with different accelerations.



My plan was to use the "/<device\_name>/get\_velocity"-service, but it turns out this just mirrors the inputs from "set\_velocity, right?



Is there an easy way to get the actual velocity(a service would be prefered)?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/07/2019 15:15:05
You should make sure that the total mass of both side of the joint are equal (and probably that the center of mass at an equivalent distance of the joint too).


Ok, that should indeed be feasible in Webots.

`@Dumindu` please note that CMD could find the correct Python version even if the PATH (or Path) environement variable is not correctly set because it uses the Python launcher. Webots doesn't, so you have to really check the Path variable and ensure that the Python installation directory is specified in the PATH.


In the `bumper.wbt` simulation if you click with the mouse on the black box in front of the robot you will trigger a collision (the same as the robot hits the wall)


you can achieve it using different methods:

1. modeling a button using the TouchSensor device ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor#bumper-sensors](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor#bumper-sensors) see `projects/samples/devices/worlds/bumper.wbt` for a sample simulation)

2. using the Mouse API and handling the mouse events on the controller (see for example [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#mouse\_events-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#mouse_events-wbt))

Otherwise it could also be useful to look directly at the code of the sample simulations: for example at `projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt`.

It is true that most of the docs contains C examples, but the python API matches almost one to one the C API.

`@machinekoder` it is correct that the Connector, as all the devices in Webots, can only be inserted as a descendant of a Robot node. This is because in general devices can only be controlled/activated by controller program that has to be associated with a Robot node.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 10/04/2019 09:10:12
Let me know if once this is done you still have issues


1. if you need synchronization, you should call the `/robot/time_step` service from your node with a non-null argument. It is also strongly adviced to add the `--synchronize` argument in the controllerArgs field of each robot (se more info here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros?tab=ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-ros?tab=ros#using-the-standard-ros-controller)).

2. Each robot should call it's `/robot/time_step` service.


Hi `@Tahir`

##### Tahir [Moderator] 10/04/2019 08:48:10
Hey Guys

I am using webots to simulate multiple robots. I am using ROS and currently having synchronization problems.

Can someone tell me:

1. How to use wb\_robot\_step when using ROS, as we have no option to use it in the context of controller.

2. How to sync multiple homogeneous robots i.e. every robot should have its own wb\_robot\_step or just one which executes the next physics step would be enough.

Thanks in advance

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 10/04/2019 06:08:09
You can import whatever 3D map in Webots given you convert them to VRML97 format. Importing a Blender-generated elevation grid is a typical use case. The Blender to webots exporter may turn our to be useful for such operations: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)


Hi Himil,

Webots indeed provides highly realistic 3D images for its camera sensors compared to other robot simulators, so that's probably the best choice for your application. Creating environments that generates close to photo-realistic images requires some expertise, but you can start from existing samples and play with the parameters (lights, backgrounds, materials, etc.). A good starting point may be the following environment: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-environments#hall-wbt](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-environments#hall-wbt)

##### Himil 10/03/2019 20:31:20
Also what sort of maps are importable in Webots ? Can i make a elevationgrid in blender and import it here ?


Hey guys, 

We are group of CMU students and planning to use Webots for our capstone project. One of the requirement is a photorealistic images from Webots so that we can use them for SLAM and 3D reconstruction algorithm.

Can someone guide me to a sample or some tutorial on it ?

Hi `@MaWa`, from the output it seems you have another conflicting installation of traci in 'Program files(x86)\Eclipse\Sumo'. This other version is probably not compatible with the one used by Webots. Please make sure that this path is not included neither in your PYTHONPATH and PATH environment variables

##### MaWa 10/03/2019 11:24:20
`@Fabien Rohrer` 

The Python example ->WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt works just fine. I can control the 3 robots and there is no crash. So I think Python is working with Webots software.



My version of Python out of cmd.exe -> "python --version" -> Python 3.7.4 (64bit) So the Path is also set correct



If I set the option to --disable-traffic-lights

is it a possibility for you to disable the traffic lights? (By passing "--disable-traffic-lights" to the sumo\_supervisor.py controller, thanks to the SumoSupervisor.enableTrafficLights field). This would bypass the problematic code.


Do you use a special version of Python 3.7? You should install it as described here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python)


Your issue is weird, we just tested sumo with python 2.7 and 3.7 and it seems to work well.


traci is released in Webots, so there is no versioning. My previous comment has not much sense.


Ok, more info...

`@JoHn`, about your second issue with vehicles and ROS, unfortunately there are no specific tutorial for vehicles with ROS, but as you said there is no real difference (juste a few more services and topics), so this tutorial is valid for vehicles too: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-8-using-ros](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-8-using-ros)

The only main difference is that instead of the 'ros' controller you should use the 'ros\_automobile' one.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 10/03/2019 06:52:44
Hi `@JoHn`, for the `time_step` question: also in vehicle simulation you have to use the same service `<modelName>/robot/time_step`. All the required instructions for the vehicle are then executed internally by the ros\_automobile controller.


`@Saha` Welcome! I would suggest you to start from our tutorials: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)

Okay, I got it.  I will try. Thanks for your precious and useful advise.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:29:34
Another clue; I have done some experiments about gripping, and controlling the hand in torque control (rather than in position control) gives better results (you can adjust precisely the used strength)


I think that if you would like to have a better grip, you can act on the 3 parameters mentioned above: 1. box alignment, 2. stifness (due to joint torques or general physics paramaters such as ERP/CFM/basicTimeStep), 3. the contact friction between the finger and the box (ContactFriction). The good action depends on your requirements.

##### Owen 10/01/2019 12:24:26
I think that the black box and finger are misaligned. Is this the main problem to my simulation?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:17:30
.. and if the contact point has a big friction.


Are the black box and the fingers perfectly aligned? As in reality, 2 point collisions are possible in this case if the box is misaligned, and the stifness of the finger joints is really big.


Ok

##### Owen 10/01/2019 12:15:15
I'm sure that the two objects are box nodes.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 10/01/2019 12:14:02
Are you sure these objects are defined by 2 Box nodes (cf. Solid.boundingObject) ?


I see. You can indeed expect to have a contact line there.

##### Owen 10/01/2019 12:11:59
The situation is just like this. It looks like there are more than one point contacting black object, but actually there are only one point.

Another alternative is to use a script which runs Webots as a slave and create one Webots instance per individual training.


You could also think about to use another method than supervisor.simulationReset(). For example to reset only the robot position, its physics and its motors.


Unfortunately no; Your controller should deal with this. For example by storing its state before reseting it, and restore it.

As long as they are in the path and you take them into account in your Makefile everything should works fine with external dependencies, it works the same way as for controllers ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)).

##### Raggy 09/27/2019 06:39:09
(Although that calls CPython's code too, not sure how webots handles external dependencies)


Even if there isn't integration with webots, it is probably possible to use Cython to generate C files directly and paste those into webots  `@Cyberninja`

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/27/2019 06:36:29
Yes, that can indeed be a solution in that case, thanks for the pointer

##### Raggy 09/27/2019 06:35:56
So you can generate those compiled files and directly link those


Cython compiles Python to C

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/27/2019 06:34:56
If I am not wrong Cython is for calling C function from Python right ?

For example if you want to see as if you were the robot you have to put the viewpoint 'inside the robot' at the same position as its 'eyes'


Yes, you have to put the initial position of the viewpoint where you want it to be (then it is going to keep its position/orientation relatively to the robot constant).

##### alinux 09/23/2019 12:36:41
I am using a Simulated Annealing controller for find a target and I want to implement a way to avoid the collisions. I will give a look on that Physics collide function and see if it works in my case.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 12:35:50
But if you want to detect collisions with any part of the robot, then you should add many TouchSensor devices (one per joint Solid)


Alternatively you can add a TouchSensor device to the model and use the TouchSensor API to check for collisions.


Then you can pass data from the physics plugin to your controller using the `dWebotsSend` ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/utility-functions#dwebotssend)) function


The most generic way to detect collisions is to use a Physics Plugin ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/physics-plugin)) and implement the `webots_physics_collide` function ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions#int-webots\_physics\_collidedgeomid-dgeomid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions#int-webots_physics_collidedgeomid-dgeomid))


> I just wanna get on the controller when there are collisions. There is a way to do that?

Yes! This is possible


which function are you using in your controller to get the collisions?

##### alinux 09/23/2019 12:25:58
I have already enabled the selfCollision flag


I just wanna get on the controller when there are collisions. There is a way to do that?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 12:15:16
the `selfCollision` flag doesn't give any information about the collided object. Which information do you need?


you can change the value from the Webots scene tree by selecting the irb Robot.selfCollision item


in that case you need to enable the `selfCollision` flag

##### alinux 09/23/2019 12:07:05
Apparently when it collides with that table, my controller is ignored


Yes, there's a table that is part from the robot

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 12:05:01
this flag defines if collisions between parts of the robot are detected. But it doesn't have any impact on collisions with other objects that are not part of the robot itself.


`@alinux` Did you already check the description of the `selfCollision` flag on the robot documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot)

##### alinux 09/23/2019 11:37:23
`@Stefania Pedrazzi` Can I get some information from selfCollision? I wanna add a penalty on the controller when the robot is colliding with something

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 09/23/2019 06:31:33
You should also check that the Robot.selfCollision flag is enabled ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot)) otherwise, if the table and the arm are part of the same robot, the collision between the two will be ignored.


If not you could also try to tune the contactProperties (see [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)).


Hi `@alinux`, usuallly reducing the world time step (defined in `WorldInfo.basicTimeStep`) helps fixing this issue.

`@LukasBoy2000`,


You should try to use only the boost version from your system and not the one of Webots.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/19/2019 16:02:20
You're right, one possible solution would be to add the includes and libraries  to your  ros installation in the makefile. It is the `INCLUDE` and `LIBRARIES` variable:

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros\_automobile/Makefile#L53](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros_automobile/Makefile#L53)

##### ClLebi 09/19/2019 15:56:10

##### ClLebi 09/19/2019 15:04:28
What has to be done in the Makefile to link properly ros, tf, etc ?


I make it works by copy /opt/ros/kinetic/include/nav\_msgs into webots/projects/default/controllers/ros/include, but if I want to use TF, it's more complicated

In the e-puck robot, the Focus node is not defined, so the focal length has not much sense, if I'm not wrong.


The principal point is at the center of the near plane. In 3D, it's (0, 0, -0.05) (5 centimeters in the direction of the camera axis: -z). This value has not much sense in 2D (width/2, height/2 üôÇ ? ).

The focal length is defined optionally by the Focus.focalLength field (to define the depth of field shader).


So the principal point matches directly with the Camera.near field.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/16/2019 08:23:16
Could you try to reduce the OpenGL preferences? (Tools / Preferences / OpenGL)


Ok, it seems Webots crashes for an unknown reason..

##### pavlos27t 09/16/2019 08:21:42
i open this file     Webots\projects\samples\robotbenchmark\maze\_runner\worlds\maze\_runner.wbt     and everything works fine,  then i go to Wizards -> New Project Directory  and i create a new project with the default world settings and it terminates of its own after a  few seconds while trying loading the world.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/16/2019 06:31:27
These motion files are released in Webots, in the WEBOTS\_HOME / projects/robots/softbank/nao/motions/*.motion path.


>>> WbMotionRef motions[3] = {

  wbu\_motion\_new("path/to/Forwards.motion"),

  wbu\_motion\_new("path/to/TurnLeft40.motion"),

  wbu\_motion\_new("path/to/HandWave.motion")

};



int counter = 0;

while (true) {

  counter = (counter + 1) % 3;

  wbu\_motion\_play(motions[counter]);

  do {

    wb\_robot\_step(TIME\_STEP);

  }

  while (! wbu\_motion\_is\_over(motion));

}


For example, to play three motion consecutively in loop (I didn't test this snippet):


You could write a C (or other) controller which plays the motion files one after the other. The Motion API allows to do this.

##### Amrita 09/15/2019 19:36:03
And how can i download files from above provided link.?


Or guide me if there is any other way.

Thank you in advance


`@Fabien Rohrer`  yes sir i went through earlier, edited these motion files and obtained various results,

what i am asking is how can i get the robot perform 3 or more tasks one after other.  means first go straight then take turn then go forward like this.



do we have any c program for it?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/15/2019 11:28:48
`@pavlos27t` This is weird. For sure it's not the expected behavior üòâ We need more information to help you. What is the controller you are trying to build? A sample we release? In which language? C?


These motions are certainly not matching exactly 0.5 m and 45¬∞ but it's certainly a good starting point to achieve your goal.

@Armita yes it's possible. We developed at some point a bunch of predefined motion files (closed loop) for the Nao which can be played using the Webots motion API:

Hello everyone , i just downloaded Webots distribution for Windows and i'm having this problem:    When i open a world file(.wbt) from tutorials projects everything is ok , but when i create a new empty project the program terminates of its own after a few seconds. Could you help me to solve this problem?

Hello sir, 

I am new here, i am working on humanoid robot NAO,

and i am trying to move the robot like it perform task in choreographe (software to control real nao)



there we can easily give command to move upto 1 m then move left upto 0.5 m then take a turn of 45 degree and reach the target, 

Can we do the same here in C programming?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/13/2019 14:53:07
About optimizing the simulation speed, unfortunately I don't see any simple solution for this, maybe my collegue `@Fabien Rohrer` (who originally did the video you are refeering to) has some idea, but he is out of the office today, I will ask him next week.


`@Gaarci` , I have made several test and I can explain the difference you get between the C and C++ versions, it is because of the time step, in the C version you define the time step using a #define to be 64. But in the C++ version you use the  world time step (getBasicTimeStep()) which is equal to 8. therefore your C++ controller makes 4 times more steps than the equivalent C version. I have tested to use 64 in both and the simulation speed is very similar.


You're welcome

##### Gaarci 09/13/2019 13:33:04
Ok, thank you a lot for the time you took to respond an help me !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/13/2019 13:32:17
Ok thank you, everything seems correct with your world and controllers.

I will try to run them (a bite later in the afternoon) and let you know if a see any possible optimization.

No, it's not the field of a proto, just a "basic shape" that I generated thanks to Blender (and converted to a world using the blender's plugin on the cyberbotics website)


Thank you a lot for the response !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/13/2019 13:11:44
Hi Gaarci. Changing the vertices at each step is computationnally expensive on the Webots side and it seems 'normal' that you have a slow simulation speed. But this might also depend on the field you are changing, is it a field of a PROTO? About the C++, it is very strange as the C++ API is just a wrapper for the C API, is it possible to share your simulation/controller so that we can check if there is a way to speed this up ?

##### Gaarci 09/13/2019 12:56:12
How did you get something so smooth ? Also, why do C++ supervisor seems to be so muche slower ?


and secondly, the exact same supervisor coded in C++ runs 10 time slower


I encounter two mains problem, 1. the simulation is "pretty slow" : Moving 93 points by iteration, the simulation can "only run" at 50% the speed


I use "wb\_supervisor\_field\_get\_mf\_vec3f" and "wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_mf\_vec3f" to modify a shape that is defined  by an IndexFaceSet, with 93 points.


Hey everyone, I'm working with clement and I've been trying to implements the "supervisor approach"  to deform a mesh (like this video) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKxdaNqmQco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKxdaNqmQco)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/12/2019 06:21:06
Hi `@Edit` , yes you can use the Supervisor API ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)) to change the structure of your robot during the simulation, however new devices (such motors) requires that you reboot the controller (also feasible with the Supervisor API). Another alternative would be to use connectors: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector)

You physics plugin may transmit instructions to a Supervisor.


Yes, exactly.

##### Clement 09/11/2019 09:46:56
The physics plugin API provides the dWebotsSend function to send messages to robot controllers and the dWebotsReceive function to receive messages from robot controllers.


Ok I see. I think I've seen somewhere in the doc that the physics plugin can "speak" with a controller through an emiter/receiver. Is that right ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/11/2019 09:42:12
the physics plugin has only access to ODE, not the graphical parts.

##### Clement 09/11/2019 09:41:16
Wow cool! Is it possible to do this from the physics plugin ? The idea is to compute the deformation in the physics plugin through an external library and  modify the mesh accordingly.

If you can cheat at some point and get the robot absolute position (by using a GPS or a Supervisor), you can simply move the robot in this direction.


`@fateme` Hello.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/10/2019 13:49:57

Hi. Why not defining your global constants in a single file? The controllers may read it.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/10/2019 13:45:01
So, my questions are; is it possible to have global variables, which each Matlab controller can access? So that one module can access the previous module‚Äôs calculated speeds.

If not, is my only option to build the system as a single robot with lots of children within children etc?

Hi again. I have a question about using Matlab as the controller for multiple robots linked together. For my project, I am making a snake-like robot and currently I am modelling it as multiple robots using connectors to link them together. The problem is I have built a mathematical controller, which calculates the motor speeds and angles for the drive and joint motors, for each module, depending on the speeds and angles of the modules in front of it.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/09/2019 14:00:13

`@aknuclear`, the controller folder is in the project directory close to the world file. You can open the controller in the Webots text editor by right clicking on your robot and selecting 'Edit Controller'. Please find more information about the structure of a Webots project here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-standard-file-hierarchy-of-a-project)


`@Edit`, or you might also be interested by the connector device: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector)


`@Edit`, what you are looking for is the Supervisor API: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)


`@daapa`, yes this is possible, to do that you have to inverse the 'shaftAxis' (e.g. put `0 -1 0`), you will then have to inverse the 'thrustConstant' too otherwise the thrust will be in the wrong direction.


`@ShalomShalom` , unfortunately `@MariusJuston` is right, from autodesk Inventor, only the shapes will be exported, you will have to re-specify the joints in Webots, joints are only exported from blender when using our exporter: [https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/cyberbotics/blender-webots-exporter)

I completely forgot about the loop... now it works

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 14:01:49
Let me know if something is not clear or if you think the result still doesn't make sense


- It can be confusing, but the position returned by the supervisor function is one step late compared to the one of the gui (it make sens because the simulation move one step between your controller step and then when you read the value in the gui).

  - I also see in the world file that you did run the simulation and then saved it. This is not a good practice (which can lead to instabilities), you should try to make sure that when you save your simulation the time is always 0.00.


Ok, I checked and I get the same result from the controller and from, the gui, just a few remarks:

  - Make sure to select the 'DEF PEN Pen' node in the three.

  - In the 'Position' tab make sure to select 'Absolute'

  - Your controller doesn't have any loop, so it run one step and then quit (and therfore only print the initial position).


Ok, let me try

And how can I get the absolute position with the supervisor?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 12:32:09
In the GUI you can select in which reference (locally, globally, etc) you want the position. With the supervisor it also depends if you get the translation field or the node absolute position, this can explain the difference if the references are not the same.

##### alinux 09/06/2019 12:30:41
I was trying to get with the supervisor, but the position it gives me is not the same as in the GUI

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 12:20:12
You told me you wanted it from the GUI...

From the code you should either use a GPS node attached to the PEN: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps)

Either use the Supervisor APi which allows you to get the position of any node in the scene: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_position](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_get_position)

`@David Mansolino`  but how I get that position by code?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/06/2019 12:05:40
`@alinux` , you can get the position of any node by selecting it and checking it's position  in the 'Position' tab of the field editor ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-scene-tree#field-editor)).

Note that Python is not a requirement to run Webots. You can for example run all the guided tour without Python installed.


2. Run Webots in safe mode following these instructions: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)


1. Check your GPU drivers are up-to-date

Yes, a slider joint actuated by a linear motor

##### Clement 09/04/2019 16:32:52
or maybe a linearmotor, yes it could do it


you're speaking about SliderJoint ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 16:29:57
Could this match your expectations?


then, you can move the 2 sliders in order to match your path, this will move the arm accordingly.


you could create a robot having an physics arm mounted on a vertical kinematics motorized slider mounted on an horizontal kinematics motorized slider.


Maybe I have a better solution to propose you:


Yes exactly.

##### Clement 09/04/2019 16:22:11
ok I understand. And using the physics engine I'll have to represent all the mecanism of the moving part ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 16:11:54
You may achieve results by removing physics from the solid and by moving the box using a Supervisor.


In Webots we usually differentiate kinematics vs physics motions, respecively without running the physics engine and  forcing the position vs using the physics engine to compute the positions.

##### Clement 09/04/2019 16:08:40
what do you mean be a kinematic motion ?


No,  the cube would just be a support for a robotic arm

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 16:06:23
i.e. Could a kinematic motion do the job?


Do you need physics on the cube?


Hi Clement

ok thanks, looks like Ive got it working

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/04/2019 15:14:44
Not sure exactly where you should put the file, but probably in the same folder than the controller.

You probably want to add the `desktop;` line at the beginning of your controller to use the desktop version of matlab for debugging.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/04/2019 15:13:15
Although I cant get Python working on this computer, and I dont really know it anyway - hence why im trying to use matlab for everything as thats what I have the most experience with


`@Fabien Rohrer`  Yes thanks! managed to get the connectors working


I guess I'm really trying to make a subroutine in matlab really


So in this example, After 5 seconds the motor is set to a position (Joint\_Angle) but I would like that to be calculated using a function, 'ang\_cal' from a certain input

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 09/04/2019 15:01:30
If you write your controller in matlab yes it should be possible as the controller will be interpreted by Matlab.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/04/2019 14:54:29
so If I write a function in normal Matlab is it possible to have a robot's controller use it inside Webots?

Hi again, If I'm writing a controller in Matlab code is it possible to get the code to call another function?

##### ClLebi 09/04/2019 09:59:10
I got it !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:49:55
We choose y-axis up because it's in the VRML and X3D specification. So the geometric primitives are working directly (without transformation). Otherwise, we have to rotate all the plans and elevation grids for example.

##### ClLebi 09/04/2019 09:48:52
Nice ! I didn't know we have only this parameter to change !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:48:33
Several computation (like the main viewpoint movements) are computed thanks to this vector.


One thing to know is that the the WorldInfo.gravity vector should be changed accordingly.


All our assets support to be rotated.


You can setup a world with up along the z axis.


Hi Cleni, this direction is quite arbitrary in fact.

##### ClLebi 09/04/2019 09:45:30
Hi guys, I'm wondering if it's possible to change the world frame to have Z in up direction ? In my point of view it's weird to have Y up, and we make some mistakes using IMU etc ...

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:42:22
To go deeper; this value is directly responsible of the physics engine accuracy. the smaller it is, the more physics steps there is per seconds. As our physics engine works with discrete steps, some penetration is required to be able to detect a collision. In any case, a penetration exists in such physics engine. It can only be reduced.

##### Owen 09/04/2019 09:38:01
Awesome, it really work. The overlapping problem is improved a lot. Thanks.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 09:30:18
Ideal value would be 8 (or 4?)


The parameter which affects the most this kind of penetration is certainly WorldInfo.basicTimeStep

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/04/2019 07:24:48
If you have old simulations, you may fix them.


You should take a look at the RectangleArena.floorAppearance field and the RectangleArena.floorTileSize fields.


We changed a lot our rendering engine between R2018 and R2019 (we added HDR backgrounds, PBR appearances, and used them intensively) causing few minor modifications in the Assets, like the RectangleArena.

##### jacqueline 09/04/2019 07:21:15

`@SamSmurfitt` Here is a working solution with active connectors. I simply copied the yamor values inside your robot.

\# Emitter side



\# dummy values to test

phiR = 1.0

self.emitter.send()



\# Receiver side

data = struct.unpack('ff', receiver.getData())

Using the struct module, you can stringify any data and extract it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 18:10:26
import struct

And to extract:

message = struct.pack("chd","a",45,120.08)

emitter.send(message)


You can send more complex data using the Python struct module as explained here : [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter?tab=python)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/03/2019 15:57:34
For sure, the direct parent of the connector should have physics and boundingObject defined.


Better results?


distanceTolerance 0.05

numberOfRotations 0


But to test I recommend you to exagerate the thresholds:


Simple set the type to ¬´¬†passive¬†¬ª and autoLock to TRUE should do the job

##### SamSmurfitt 09/03/2019 15:41:59
Yeah ideally without using the controller, although I can do if I have to

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system)


A very important point with the connectors is that the local z-axis of the 2 connecting Connectors should point each other, as depicted in this image. And y-axis should match at best.


Visually, it seems good.

##### SamSmurfitt 09/03/2019 15:07:04

You should start with the second one (which is simpler to setup and to debug).

Actually... ignore that I just found the .proto file


Hi Fabien, I've just finished doing the tutorials this afternoon. Is it possible to get hold of the Yamor files? I've opened up the .wbt file and all it shows is that it is made of multiple modules. I was hoping to find information on how to build one of those modules.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:42:48
I hope this helps üòâ


But basically, you could also try to "hack" the yamor model to change the joint axis and add wheels. Learning this is the focus of the first tutorials.


.. and finally / eventually encapsulate your model in a .proto file in order to be able to instanciate it easily.


Then to add the Connector at the right position, using the Yamor as an inspiration.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


I would recommend you to do our tutorial first to learn how to create simple robots and to be able to move the joints wherever you want:


Hi Sam

##### SamSmurfitt 09/02/2019 15:37:50
Hi all. Quick question. What would be the best way to go about making a robot similar to Yamor? I.e module links with 1 d.o.f rotating connection between them? 

I'm trying to simulate a snake-like robot similar to yamor but with the joint axis being vertical on each module, not horizontal, and having motorised wheels on each module to move it forwards

2. Or communicate between the robot controller and the supervisor.


1. Merge your supervisor to your robot controller.


You can think to:


Ok I see. In this case this will be annoying because you cannot access directly the devices of a robot controller through an external supervisor.

E-puck [

  controller "e-puck\_avoid\_obstacles" # This should point your supervisor controller.

  supervisor TRUE

]


you don't need to create a Supervisor node, but you need to enable the supervisor flag on your e-puck node:

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 15:06:58
On controller node it works but on supervisor node it does not

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 15:06:38
E-puck.controller => your controller


Are you sure you defined well the controller field?


"ps0" is indeed a distance sensor name of the E-puck.proto model. This seems to be correct.

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 15:05:11
I am using only one e-puck


It is not recognizing the device.


Hi Fabien Rohrer, when I use this function I get an error. Warning: "ps0" device not found.

[rnnGAsupervisor\_Jh] Error: wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable(): invalid device tag.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 14:57:51
Note that you cannot get the devices of another robot. The Robot/Supervisor API are bound to get only the devices of the current robot.

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 14:57:08
Nice, I was trying to use some supervisor function instead.  Thanks.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 14:56:43
cf. [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_device](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_device)


Therefore, you can access the Supervisor devices using the wb\_robot\_get\_device() functions as usual.


Programmatically speaking, the Supervisor is a subclass of the Robot class, therefore, what is true in a robot controller is also true in a supervisor controller.


Hi

##### jhielson 09/02/2019 14:54:05
Hi, I am a new user on Webots and I am trying to figure out how can I access the distance sensor data through the supervisor node. I got the position and rotation of the robot but I do not know about the sensors.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state\_machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)


It's the state of the finite state automaton:


this mode is simply a variable defining the robot behavior


ok I see

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:55:15
Because they doesn't appear to be programed in other part of the .py or the driver. But they move the robot for some reason and the code doesn't crash


Actually I was wondering about these modes

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:47:59
One last question... is there a way to know what the self.Mode.something functions are available for the e-puck?


Now I get it, distance sensors from the old robot were "ds" and now they are "ps"

In the user guide, the sensors and actuators of the robots are listed into the 3D component on top of the page:

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:35:58
Okay Thank you very much, do you know where can I find the names and functions of the e-puck. I dont know why but I'm having a really hard time doing this simulation. I barely can find about the e-puck in webots

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 09/02/2019 06:34:26
You should check the actuator and sensor names match with your new robot.


This may be the reason of the crash.


The controller may have some code relative to the robot, typically the actuator and sensor names.


Hi

##### Frodo 09/02/2019 06:32:51
Do you guys know why I cant change the robot from the example.wbt from the python folder to an e-puck robot. When I do that it just tells me "INFO: slave: Starting controller: python.exe -u "slave.py"

`@ClLebi` if you call the ``ROS::run`` function the ``launchRos`` function is called automatically.

##### ClLebi 08/30/2019 09:05:52
I didn't use launchRos in my controller, I'll test it

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/30/2019 06:30:25
`@ClLebi`, no you should not need to change anything to your controller. The `launchRos` function will parse the arguments and publish the clock if needed: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L132](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros/Ros.cpp#L132)

Can you please check if you have the same problem with the default ros controller?

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 17:07:32
(Of course the use\_sim\_time rosparam is set to true)


Another question, I added the "--synchronize --clock --use-sim-time" args on  controllerArgs but still no /clock published. Is there any line to add in my controller to take this controllerArgs into account ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 16:03:44
Very good news! You're welcome !

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:59:43
Based on the ros\_automobile example I successfully compiled my ros controller ! Thank you David !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 15:45:28
Ok then creating your custom ros controller seems indeed the way to go.

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:44:48
Yes I'm using it but I'm trying to have a ROS C++ controller for my robot to control topics, datatypes (like using PointCloud2 instead of PointCloud for LiDAR)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 15:44:44
> Thank you ! I tested with the Python but I'm working with LiDAR and it's too slow for me !



In that case C++ is indeed most probably the way to go. But make sure before that your GPU is powerful enough and your GPU drivers are up to date (this can drastically influence the simulation speed when using lidars).


finnally, you might also be interested by this repo that gather a few example of ROS nodes that use the default ROS controller to communicate with Webots: 

[https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros)

This package is released with ros and is documented here: [http://wiki.ros.org/webots\_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros)


If you are interested in ROS2, we are currently creating an interface with ROS2, this interface will be much simpler to integrate and to use, here is the repository (this is still work in progress but is starting to be functional): [https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots\_ros2](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2)

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:41:46
I'm gonna look on your links


Thank you ! I tested with the Python but I'm working with LiDAR and it's too slow for me !

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/29/2019 15:40:49
We are recently doing a lots of progress on this topic. On our main github repo you can find the source of the default ros controller: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/default/controllers/ros)

This default controller can then be used as a base to create your own C++ ROS controller, here is an example for a car interface for example: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros\_automobile](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/vehicles/controllers/ros_automobile)

Another possibility is to use the python API, we have a very simple example of this here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros\_python](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/revision/projects/languages/ros/controllers/ros_python)


Hi `@ClLebi`

##### ClLebi 08/29/2019 15:21:59
Hi, 

Do you guys have a github where I can find an example of custom ROS controller written in C++ ? I've red in the Guide that it's possible ("It is possible to implement such a ROS node in C++ using the "roscpp" library on Linux and macOS. However, in this case, you need to setup a build configuration to handle both the "catkin\_make" from ROS and the "Makefile" from Webots to have the resulting binary linked both against the Webots "libController" and the "roscpp" library.") and I wonder if there is an example ? Thanks a lot ! I discovered Webots yersterday and I love it !

The Webots motion file mechanism aims to play back a stored motion in simulation. You would like to map the Kinect and the Webots simulated robot in real-time, right? In this case, it seems more appropriated to not use the Webots motion file mechanism, but rather to directly move the simulated robot actuators.

##### smruti 08/29/2019 14:43:18
sorry i can't get u

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/29/2019 14:42:26
Using the motion mechanism is certainly overkilled. Why not simply and directly actuating the simulated robot motors? (cf. Motor.setPosition(double pos))

##### smruti 08/29/2019 14:39:34
actually i m getting my data from kinect and using that data i m getting my joints angle (motor positions)using python . Now i have information of angles of left shoulder pitch and roll, left elbow pitch and roll.Now i want it to be in a file that webots can read.so how should i do that?Continuosly i will be getting data from kinect which will be given to webots .So how should i continuosly convert it to motion files?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 08/29/2019 14:08:25
Basically, the header list the motor names, and each line contain a pose (time,posName,motorPositions*)


You should try to forge a similar file.

HI `@Frodo`, if you don't car about realistic motion/control, a good solution is to set the 'kinematic' field of the e-puck node to TRUE. Then the Supervisor is indeed the way to go, you can get move/rotate the robot at any position you want.

##### Frodo 08/26/2019 21:55:52
Hello everybody! I'm new to Webots and I'm developing a bioinspired algorith based on a bug from the family psocoptera. I already have tried it on Matlab but now i want to implement it using e-puck robots. Nevertheless, I'm looking for a way to control them like sending positions or velocities to the robots like goto(). So I don't know if there's already some function that does that or I'll have to implement it by myself. I'm not really interested in a realistic control method since, for now, I just want to get the robots moving with my algorithm. I've already looked at something called Compass and Supervisor but I couldn't manage to find some examples with the e-puck. I'm using Python. Thank you in advance for your advice!

(like the AltinoWheel.name field mentioned above)


To be accessible from the Supervisor, the field should be "open", i.e., defined as a regular field in the PROTO definition.


Is it this case?


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/saeon/protos/AltinoWheel.proto#L8](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/saeon/protos/AltinoWheel.proto#L8)


To verify this, simply look at your PROTO header (open it in a text editor), and check if this field has the "hiddenField" keyword, like here:


Hi Marcey, it seems you are getting a field which is hidden in the PROTO definition.

##### Marcey 08/26/2019 08:59:30
Hi, I'm using ROS to get to the translation of my robot. In my program I use the "node\_get\_field"-service. This worked until I tried to convert my Robot to a PROTO. Now I can not get the translation field anymore. The supervisor API says :



    Note: The wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field function will return a valid field handler if the field corresponding to the field name is an hidden field.



What would be the correct field name to get the handler to a hidden field?

hi `@Heisenberg`: light sensors don't make any different between colored lights. To detect a colored light, I would recommend to use a small white box put in front of a low resolution camera. The box will reflect the color of the light and the camera will get it.

I was applying a force which includes a 'for' loop to a vehicle's wheel in the physics plugin,(in physics step, dbodyaddforce).  the force was supposed to be calculated by integration, I simply use a for loop to add things up. If the division of the integeration is over 3(three times in for loop) and the force was applied, the webots crash. However, if the force is only displayed and calculated in webots, but not applied, the division of the integration could go as high as 1000 and still runs smoothly. And the forces calculated by normal means like adds multiflies and such works normally. I tried many methods, but none worked. I wonder if you guys have any clues to this...üò´

Can you try to use in your physics plugins the equivalent than in the Webots contact properties:

contact->surface.mode = (bounce != 0.0 ? dContactBounce : 0) | dContactApprox1 | dContactSoftCFM | dContactSoftERP;

contact->surface.bounce = bounce;
contact->surface.bounce_vel = bounceVelocity;
contact->surface.soft_cfm = softCFM;

##### NERanger 08/21/2019 14:19:34
`@David Mansolino` I am not using asymetric friction. I use mu for the friction between tractor wheel and ground, should I enable rolling firction instead?

`@NERanger`, the behavior you mention is strange, the only difference between `coulombFriction` and `mu` is that `mu` is set to `dInfinity` if `coulombFriction` is -1.

This is done here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/0e8541fc48cda235cec85f6d3131dcf13c93a3c2/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L228](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/0e8541fc48cda235cec85f6d3131dcf13c93a3c2/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L228)



And then assigned to the contact surface here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L279](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L279)

Are you sure you are setting correctly the flags in your physics plugin? In Webots this is done here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L333](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/src/webots/engine/WbSimulationCluster.cpp#L333))

Are you using asymetric friction (more than one value in the `coulombFriction` field)?

##### NERanger 08/20/2019 16:14:51
I wonder if there is a difference between the field "coulombFriction" in the node "ContactProperties" and the mu in struct "dSurfaceParameters" in ODE explained as the "coulomb Friction coefficient". I have this question because when I am using ContactProperties, set coulombFriction to 1 is enough to prevent slip, but when I am using collsion handling callback function provided by Webots, I always need to set the "mu" to about 200 to prevent slip (I do not want to set it to infinity since I need to implement "slip ratio"). I suspect that the "mu" explained as "coulomb Friction coefficient" in the document is actually divided by some number like 1000. But I am not sure since the document does not mention it. Can anyone tell me what is the difference between these two things? Thanks for listening to my question üòÉ

About Solidworks to Webots, you will have to export your Solidworks file to VRML2.0 which can then be imported in Webots (but you will loose some information in the process), here is an example from autodesk (but the process is very similar): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0FVsFD2rS4&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0FVsFD2rS4&feature=youtu.be)


We have a script converting an urdf file to a Webots compatible PROTO file, you can find this script here: [https://github.com/omichel/urdf2webots](https://github.com/omichel/urdf2webots)

Let us know if you have any problem with this script

Hi `@MariusJuston` .

Thanks for the .wbt.     I think the reason why it is barely noticeable when you tried it is because you need to run it at slower speeds, like 0.1 kph.   Can you run at these low speeds?   We tried the world you provided and the problem is there, just like in all the other worlds that we've tried so far.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/19/2019 07:03:07

That would be the easiest solution

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:57:22

Now that you mentioned it, perhaps I can make the name field public under proto, so I can give each a different name

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:55:42

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:53:18

Oh so what you can do is that you can get the name of the robot and then print that along side the value

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:51:01
I'm not sure if I was doing this correctly, I use println function to print values to the console, but then I was confused how to differentiate which value belongs to which robot

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:42:12
Sorry I might have been unclear. What I was saying was that each robot when it runs creates its own instance of the Controller. Thus meaning that none of the variables are shared. Each robot, if you were to have a controller that stored the values into an array would have arrays with different values. You could then, if you wanted to, export those arrays to a file such as a *.csv file. Was that what you were asking?

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:37:49
oh.. you mean like a csv file?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/19/2019 00:35:21
Well if you store it using arrays, each robot will create a unique instance of the controller so that a controller instance is only associate with the robot

##### Huey 08/19/2019 00:34:14
i wondering if there would be a way to store separate sets of values each robot collects, e.g using three identical robot in the simulation

For me it never behaves exactly how yours does, it never has wheels jumping around... all I did was copy the same WorldInfo as the moose\_demo.wbt and it works, yes the tractor still sinks a little in the ground but it is barely noticeable

##### Mr. Scruff 08/16/2019 17:30:09
Hi `@MariusJuston` .  I simplified my experiment by using the standard Boomer vehicle, and driving it in the sample terrain that comes with the Clearpath Moose terrain.   Under these conditions, we've been able to duplicate the issue where, at slow speeds, the tractor tires suddenly sink into the ground and then suddenly pop out of the ground.

Given that we are using components that come standard with Webots, without modification, can you reproduce the problem?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 21:24:09
Maybe it has something to do with the uneven terrain generator?

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 21:22:12
Hi `@MariusJuston`.   While the effects of changing the softCFM were clearly visible,  unfortunately it was not able to resolve the issue.  As you can see in the video, the tractor moves fine in certain areas, but very briefly sinks in others.  This effect does not manifest itself in flat terrains.

[https://agjunction-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/mvillela/Ead4Z4TufSBDimFK2IWp-1QBQBMu6c6aIAGeGk50m0D2Ow?e=5jG3Nk](https://agjunction-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/mvillela/Ead4Z4TufSBDimFK2IWp-1QBQBMu6c6aIAGeGk50m0D2Ow?e=5jG3Nk)


This does help.  I'm curious to see the effects of changing the softCFM.  Thanks again.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 17:09:02
Hope this helps...


To be honest I am not sure exactly how it works in the backend but I was informed when I had a similar problem of my object sinking in the ground to change the CFM and it seemed to work. From what I can understand from the documentation, imagine that you have a spring (which represents the ground) and the spring constant (k) is represented by the CFM. If you have a high spring constant (lower CFM) it will take more force for it be pressed down, if you have a low spring constant (higher CFM) it will take less force to push the spring down thus causing the object to ‚Äúsink‚Äù in the material. If you do not want the spring be able to sink you would make the spring constant infinity, in this case make the CFM 0.

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 16:59:19
I am reading about softCFM at [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)

Can you provide more in-depth information?  Perhaps a paper or some other documentation that talks about softCFM in more detail?


I will try that next.  Thank you.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 16:55:11
The object is sinking because it is so heavy


Have you tried changing the softCFM in the ContactsProperties

##### Mr. Scruff 08/15/2019 16:33:28
But the problem persists.  This happens with the front wheels and with the back wheels.  It is more easily visible when the wheels are spinning at low speeds, as shown in the video.  The problem also appears to not happen in flat terrain.


Thanks, Marius.   My basic time step is already at 4msec.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/15/2019 16:27:12

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/14/2019 14:22:57
`@David Mansolino` I have run through the steps multiple times however it is still not working for me. It is either sending my the same dll not found error still or a new `ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.`

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/14/2019 13:37:05
`@MariusJuston`, this is now documented here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-pycharm-with-webots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-pycharm-with-webots)


`@MariusJuston`, I had a bit of time to test PyCharm with Webots, there is a few tricky settings to set, but it seems to work. Can you please try the following:

  1. Open your simulation in pause mode and set the controller of the robot to `<extern>`

  2. in PyCharm select: `File->Settings->Project->Project Structure-> Add Content Root` and select webots/lib/python37 (or any other version), then OK->Apply->OK.

  3. in PyCharm select: `Run->Edit Configurations->Python', Then in the `Environment variables` value add `LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH` (or `PATH` if you are on windows) and set the value to ${WEBOTS_HOME]/lib



Please let me know if you still have any problems with this procedure.

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 17:44:07
`@MariusJuston` OK. I will try. Thank you !

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 17:39:12
For more info about what each parameter means


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo)


Usually you do not need to edit them, but if you see some things behave strangely such as objects sinking in ground you probably want to edit them

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 17:36:41
Just use the our real world's related parameter?


When you are doing your own robot simulation, how do you deal with these parameters, like basicTimeStep 10

FPS 60

ERP 0.62

CFM 1e-05, mass, coefficiency etc.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 17:35:16
But if you were to use the mantis in another world you proabbly want to have very similar world settings


That was already set in the sample world so you do not actually need to change those

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 17:33:02
Ok. Thank  you so much for your valuable time and patience!

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 17:32:14
Or if you want you can go in the PROTO of the mantis and then set the mass property in the physics node to be 1


You probably want to fiddle with columbFriction in the ContactProperties in order to increase friction. Set the columbFriction to 100 and try it now


Oh wait I did notice it slipping a little, when it was going downhill, probably due to its mass


Try reducing the basic time step maybe?


basicTimeStep 10

FPS 60

ERP 0.62

CFM 1e-05


It actually does not seem to be slipping

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 16:57:03
to escape I am running in the wrong direction.


I want to make sure there is no difference between yours and mine.


how about yours? Do your mantis' simulation has slipping ?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 16:56:09
Since the motors are set to absolute positions it is forcing the legs to go to those specific positions no matter. This causes it, if there is a slopped terrain to be lift off from the other legs, to fix this you would need to create some kind of suspention on the legs

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 16:54:23
Mine controller follows this websites[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/controllers/mantis/mantis.c](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/controllers/mantis/mantis.c)


mine worlds follow this website [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/worlds/mantis.wbt](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/micromagic/mantis/worlds/mantis.wbt)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 16:53:12
That is probably because it is going up the sloped terain

While the abnormal thing is that when I run real time simulation for the first time. It alwys shows these.


Me too.


I use the same nodes and codes as the github shows, after the matis robot walks for a while I can find feet slipping. Sorry I focus on this point. As the slipping is what I want to eliminate.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 16:30:12
I am assuming so? I am using the latest R2019b Webots

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 16:29:13
`@MariusJuston` Do you use the same nodes and codes as the github shows?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 15:53:11
I cannot seem to see the legs slipping

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 15:51:59
Hi,`@MariusJuston` can you see the webots simulation of mantis for a while again. Could you please zoom in the robot walking scenary and see the motion of the feet? When I do this, I find the feet are slipping.


Thank you! Get it! I will do it right now!

Do you mean this link [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis) ?


Thank you so much for your kind suggestion! Yes, of course I will see it now.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 15:25:00
That is really all based on timing and fine tuning the function. If you look at the graphs of the robot motors while it is running (double click the robot) you will seen the sinusoidal functions and hopefully that helps you

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 15:22:37
So I am trying to totally understand this function. Then, maybe the robot can go normal.


Hi,`@MariusJuston` Thank you! Yes. While I need a specific one. As I am confusing how  this fuction realizes which pair of feet fix on ground and only rotate the legs and when feet lift while legs rotate. My robot's feet always slip.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/13/2019 15:10:26
`wb_motor_set_position(motors[i], a[i] * sin(2.0 * M_PI * f * time + p[i]) + d[i]);` It is all part of the sinusoidal function, the amplitude tells the legs if it should from left to right or right to left and by how much it should move by

##### Yang Chen 08/13/2019 15:02:34
Hello! I see the mantis has tripod gait. Could you please show me  the code or other setup which decides when one pair of three feet fix on ground and when one pair of three feet lift the ground?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 15:16:18
Great.

##### Clement 08/12/2019 15:16:13
It works perfectly if I reduce it. Thanks a lot!


indeed it was set to 10000!!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 15:12:27
Can you reduce the maxTorque value of the motor to see whether it helps?


It looks like the force of the motor is too strong...

##### Clement 08/12/2019 15:08:00
I've tried with 16 and 8ms but I haven't seen any difference.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 15:04:45
Have you tried decreasing the 'basciTimeStep' ? Or the motor acceleration (bedefault motors have an infinite acceleration)

##### Clement 08/12/2019 15:03:24
Here is a video of the simulation: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7L2c4tgUtV1QFr1IhSEaV874-e8H3C9/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7L2c4tgUtV1QFr1IhSEaV874-e8H3C9/view?usp=sharing)


I am using the robot window that appears when I double click the robot. It allows me to move the joints individually


Well the static object is a Robot with no boundingObject but it has children which have boundingBox

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 14:49:29
What do you mean control manually from the Webots interface? If you do that from the scene tree, nothing will prevent you from colliding with objects. You should control your robot from your controller so that the simulation runs and the collision detector works.


Does your static object have a boundingObject?


Hi Clement,

##### Clement 08/12/2019 14:46:50
Hi everyone, I am playing with Webots physics/collision system and I'm facing a weird situation. I have a manipulator arm that I control manually through the Webots interface. When I make the arm push an object against a static object (no physic field), at some point the arm starts passing through the object. I was expecting the arm to be blocked. I tried setting the ERP field to 0 but it doesn't fix it. Is it possible to achieve my goal or is this a limitation from ODE ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 12:17:49

Hi

##### Liu 08/12/2019 12:02:31
My webots crashed. I try to fix the world program through opening wordpad, but it doesn't work. I also can not open other words. how do I fix it.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 08/12/2019 06:23:14
Hi `@MariusJuston`, `@Fabien Rohrer` is off for vacation, but I can try to answer for him. The Blender addon should produce .wbt files that you can open directly in Webots. If that doesn't work, please open an issue to report the problem, including your .blend file, so that we can try to reproduce it and better understand what's wrong.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/11/2019 22:26:53
`@Fabien Rohrer` for your Blender addon once you have exported your file to a *.wbt how are you supposed to open it in Webots? When I tried to open it using Open World It gave me   `Expected node or PROTO name, found '{'.` and `Failed to load due to syntax error(s).`

`@Yang Chen`, you should probably have a look at 'central pattern generators' (CPG). Here is for example an article about this: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982201005814](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982201005814)

In addition, I want to understand of this sin function. could you recommend me this gait control's  theory. I think I have trouble with the swing and stance phase control.


Hi `@David Mansolino` ,Thank you so much for your kind help! I would try this later.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/05/2019 14:43:24
`@David Mansolino` I completely understand, I will thus wait for the end of the week when he comes back.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 08/05/2019 06:23:24
Another alternative that doesn't require to change the hierarchy of your vehicle is to use indeed a physic plugin, and in the `webots_physics_collide` callback ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/callback-functions)) create a contact joint and attach a joint feedback to retrieve the force at the contact point ([http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Joint\_feedback](http://ode.org/wiki/index.php?title=Manual#Joint_feedback)).


`@NERanger` , the solution with touch-sensors that `@MariusJuston` suggested is indeed a good solution, you just need to change the wheels of your vehicles to a TouchSensor node instead of a Solid node and set the 'type' field to "force-3d"


> `@Olivier Michel` I do not know if you remember but previously I was trying to get Webots to run through PyCharm; however, the program stopped at the import statement because it had a ImportError: DLL load failed error. You tried to help me; however we did not manage to solve the issue even though I had all the environmental variables setup. You said that you were going to try it on PyCharm; however you were on your trip to China so you had to do it later. I was wondering if you had tried?



`@MariusJuston`, unfortunately `@omichel` was very very busy last week and he is now on holiday, but he will probably try when he will be back at the end of the week (do not hesitate to re-ask him üòâ )

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 08/04/2019 19:35:02
`@NERanger`  I do not know if you know but  [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor) has a force mode that can allow it to measure force or touch


The problem is probably the scaling I said inside the video Webots only takes in meters, so if you export your file in inches or mm you will see your model, when imported into Blender being way too large. To fix this either you can export your solid work file directly in the correct units (meters) which is the easiest way of doing it (I have no real idea as to how you would do it in Solidwords because I do not have it). Or you can, when you are exporting the file using blender, when you are asked where to save the file, on the left you can see a scale text bar, make it so that it return current units to meter scale. i.e if it was in inches it would be (1 m /39.3701 inches)  or 0.0254


`@Yang Chen` sorry about that. So when you imported the file as into blender did it show up as being huge?

##### Yang Chen 08/03/2019 15:30:37
I am wondering do you face up with these kind of situation befor? I plan to try the transform and unit you teach us in your vedio. As I my  Solidework 3D model  is finished by my partner.  Maybe I need to communicate with him about these problem to find out the reason. And can you give me some suggestion?


While I face up with a problem about the scale and coordinates,when imported it in Webots. I am not sure if it is due to the  Solidework 3D model ,  as I see you introduce we need transform function in Blenders in your vedio.


Thank you for kind share!

So I am assuming that you are the one that define the a, p and d arrays and f constant so you just have to change those values

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:12:52
Thank you ! this is really clear.  So how do you adjust or choose the amplitude, phase, offset

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:11:35
the a[i] is the amplitude of the motion, the 2 PI f is the frequency and p[i] is the phase shift


[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15231466/whats-the-difference-between-pi-and-m-pi-in-objc](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15231466/whats-the-difference-between-pi-and-m-pi-in-objc)


Oh that is the the PI constant so that is equivalent to 3.14....

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:06:42
Then, could you tell me the meaning of "M\_PI" in this fuction


Of course, I agree with you. And Central Pattern Generator can realize it. So ...

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 21:04:20
To be honest I am not very versed in what the Central Pattern Generator is, but I am assuming that is to make it so that that the robot always has enough points of contact to the ground in order to stay stable and still allows the robot to move forwards.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 21:02:25
Can you explain why should we use this function? Does it relate to Central Pattern Generator?

`@MariusJuston` Hi , welcome party.  it begins. I am studying the Mantis now, while the controller is using this function to control the motor's position.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 18:42:17
`@Yang Chen` sorry being late for the party but on the topic of adding CADed models to Webots what you can is that you can export your CAD as a .obj or an .stl (make sure the scaling is set to meters) then open blender, import the .stl or .obj, then install the adding that `@Fabien Rohrer` made. After importing be sure that the orientation of the object is correct to make sure, to change it select the model and the the plus button the right, that will open up a window where you can select set the orientation. Using the Addin you can the press the export button and then export to a .wbl file not a .wbt

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 17:05:08
Thank you üòÄ ! I will try. And if it is needed, I will contact sales@cyberbotics.com.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 16:43:33
[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)


Did you tried to play with ContactProperties.softERP/CFM? That‚Äôs the key to set the shrink depth.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 16:09:22
`@Fabien Rohrer` While the problem is that the I can not  define or set up precisely at which depth the robot shrinks, as this is what I plan to export or obtain from Webots.  And are there any idea about it?


Get it!  Thank you so much for your kind help and professional instruction!  And Webots are really good!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 15:45:44
For sure it's not a perfect deformation simulation, but it gives already a good approximation.


You should be able to define precisely at which depth the robot shrinks.


.. and then play with the ContactProperties.softERP and ContactProperties.softCFM (for the contact between the feet and the sand only).


To do that, first fix the WorldInfo.basicTimeStep (I would say something like 8 ms)


At least, you can set up precisely how the robot feet penetrate the ground.


About the sandy environment, you can model this quite precisely I think.


You could contact sales@cyberbotics.com with precise robot specs to have a quote if you would like to go on. I think such kind of robot could be done in about 1 week of development.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 15:39:09
I mean my teacher.


And the budget depends on my advisor.


Really a good idea! üòÄ  I learned the tutorials, and built a simple hexapod robot.


Also, how do you ( specialist) in webots  deal with the sandy properties environtment? I saw the contact properties setting. I am wondering can it realize the real scene in our real world that when a robot is walking in beach while the mutual impact bettween sand and robot's feet influence both the state of sand and robot, like the particle dynamics.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 15:35:02
personnally, I would go for the solution to rewrite it from scratch using the Webots primitives, and to copy the mantis controller.


Downscaling a robot may be tricky.


Feel free to choose your best solution üòÉ

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 15:28:56
Thank you! The hexiapod robot in your samples is really amazing and it could be control by human being ! I need a small one, about 0.5m l,  0.5m w and 0.3m h for robots' whole size and the shape should be like my physical robot.   Can I revise yours based on my physical robot?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 15:06:34
I have also to mention that we can model this for you if you have some budget for this.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


I think that you can already go far using Webots only. I recommend you to do our tutorial, you will learn there how to create a robot with Webots basic geometric primitives:


.. and your robot is close to this robot look, size and hardware: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bioloid](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bioloid)


We have an hexapod model here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mantis)


Yes, for sure. We have several legged-robots, and most of the time, we modeled their meshes and materials in Blender before migrating to Webots for the physics and robotics simulation.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 15:01:48
Is it ok for me to realize it?


the thing is I want to build hexapod robots like those in pictures, and then simulate hexapod robots walking in beach which contains sandy properties by Webots.

As you are familiar with Blender combined with our Webots, could you tell me can Blender build hexapod robots,like those in the picture.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 14:55:03
SolidWorks and other CADs are generally exporting very big meshes, hardly usable directly in Webots. Moreover, physics data (joints, etc.) are lost in this operation. Therefore, using Blender inbetween is for sure the simplest solution.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 14:53:46
`@Fabien Rohrer` Thank you for your kind help and so many materials provided! üëè


While it is worthy of it, maybe it is useful and can save time in  long run. In addition, does Solidworks and CAD make sense?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 14:52:01
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#geometric\_primitives-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-geometries#geometric_primitives-wbt)


You could also simply work with basic primitives:


.. but this requires to have skills in Blender and modeling unfortunately.


I wrote a Blender add-on to export Webots objects: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)


We used to work with 3D modeling software, especially Blender


To be honest Webots is not very good to create meshes.

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 14:47:57
in the Animated Skin sample, [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/rendering/worlds/animated\_skin.wbt](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/samples/rendering/worlds/animated_skin.wbt), Line 186. there are so many points.

üëè while I am wondering about this one

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 14:35:55
`@Yang Chen` No problems!

##### Yang Chen 07/31/2019 14:31:40
Hi, `@MariusJuston` , thank you for kind help! And give me suggestion in detail.

##### Huey 07/31/2019 12:16:33
Oh splendid! Thanks so much for sharing these `@MariusJuston`,  `@Fabien Rohrer`, earlier i was abt confused with the DEF use, as i dont always find the DEF i created, but will sure to take a second look on the documentation and other methods you have mentioned! Double thumbs up to you guys üëç  üëç

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 12:09:50
You can even be more concise using the procedural templates. Look at the SimpleStair example here: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#example](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes#example)


Solid {

  translation 0 0 0

  name "solid 1"

  children [

    Shape DEF MY\_SHAPE {

      appearance PBRAppearance {}

      geometry Box {}

    }

  ]

  boundingObject USE MY\_SHAPE

  physics DEF MY\_PHYSICS Physics {}

}

Solid {

  translation 0 0 1

  name "solid 2"

  children [

    Shape USE MY\_SHAPE

  ]

  boundingObject USE MY\_SHAPE

  physics USE MY\_PHYSICS

}

Solid {

  translation 0 0 2

  name "solid 3"

  children [

    Shape USE MY\_SHAPE

  ]

  boundingObject USE MY\_SHAPE

  physics USE MY\_PHYSICS

}


It's better to avoid to put solids in transforms, but a pattern could be:

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 12:04:21
`@Huey` if you keep the base solid node and then create a bunch of Transforms, then in the each of the transforms use the DEF and USE method to have it so that the solid is not duplicated and just reused and translated to different place. Maybe, I do not remember if transforms can handle solids

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/31/2019 12:01:52
- proto can be contain LUA scripts (containing for example for loops): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/procedural-proto-nodes)


- the DEF-USE mechanism allows to duplicate a node within some context (in a .wbt file, or in a .proto file): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/def-and-use)


Not sure if this helps, but there are several ways to avoid duplicating nodes:

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 11:59:02
Using the export/import method I believe that it will just create a replica

##### Huey 07/31/2019 11:54:35
Hi `@MariusJuston`  i find your reply to yang chen relevant to a problem i may have too. I am working on a decentralize system, and currently creating a small and abstract experiment on number of homogeneous robots to collaborate on a task. I use 'solid' to represent 'obstacle' needs to be cleared. And when i have too many of those (video), webot would tell me that the 'complicated world' might affect accuracy of calculation.



May i know using the export/import method, does it create a replica/will it reference a link to the source? Thank you

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/31/2019 04:31:20
`@Yang Chen` Sorry for the delay. A simple way to do all this, if you want to just reuse the same GROUND shape is to Export that Shape/Solid. To do this you can left click the Shape/Solid and then select the Export button, this will save the information to a .wbo, to re import this .wbo you can just press the Add button and the press Import (bottom right corner ), find your .wbo and you should see the Shape/Solid appear in the tree directory. If you want to move it around you can `Ctrl + X` (Cut) and then `Ctrl + V` (Paste) it in the location you want it to be; however, please be aware that you cannot place a Shape/Solid everywhere so if `Ctrl + V` fails you can probably assume that that is the reason.  



If you just want to copy the coordinates, you can select, the `point` field in the tree view and then `Ctrl + C` it, if you want to verify that it copied, you can open up notepad and the paste your clipboard there, if there is text then you are good. Once you have copied the points you can go to your new `Coordinate` node, select the point node and the press the delete button on your keyboard, all the points in the `point` should disappear, select `point` and then press `Ctrl + V`. You should see all the points that you copied appear in the `point` field

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:58:18
Hi  MariusJuston, thank you for your kind help. I am wondering do you mean copy one cord and paste it one by one? My question seems so absurd and easy. The reason why I am asking it is if we copy every coor and paste it on nodes like the above picture I showed you, it will be a little time consuming and easy to make mistakes. So I am wondering if I am wrong, maybe there exists other methods that I do not know.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:51:09
And then you can paste is somewhere else


Click and then press CTRl c on the cord def

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:49:52
Do you mean copying and pasting them like this?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:35:07
You can  just copy the index face set and then paste

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:33:46
Yes, that is what I am considering now. I saw the moon DEMO of Wevots and try to see if it can mimic the real moon contact properties when mimic  robots is moving on moon.    While "texCoord TextureCoordinate {

      point [ "    of    " the geometry IndexedFaceSet {

    coord DEF coord\_Plane Coordinate"     in the "moon.wbt " , there are so many cordinates, I am wondering is there other ways to input the cordinates instead  of  printing it in nodes.


Thank you so much! I will try and learn soon.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:29:06
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bb8](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/bb8)


Maybe look at the bb 8 example


That is harder I do not know if Webots can do it, I believe that there are ways to change the surface in the contact surface property field

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:23:18
Sandy properties. Like robot is  walking in beach.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/30/2019 17:22:05
Like do you mean having sandy properties or just looks like sand?

##### Yang Chen 07/30/2019 17:20:28
Hello is there someone who simulate robots walking in sandy environment? Thank you!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 15:36:01
Very good news, thank you for the feedback. Indeed you probably need to write a ROS node instead of using the command line.

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 14:49:05
Ah ok, I finally was successfull üòÉ Thank you! My problem was to transfer the information in the supervisor API into a correct command line. 



Today I also learned that using the terminal to change the position is propably not practical because node handle and field handle change every time webots is restarted. I'll try to find an other way

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 13:42:26
Probably before trying to use Supervisor Services you should get familiar with the Supervisor API, I would strongly recommend to read the Supervisor documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)

And have a look at this example (including the code): [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#supervisor-wbt)


You first need to get the node id: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_from\_def](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb_supervisor_node_get_from_def)

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 13:34:21
hm, for this service I need a value of the 'node'. How do I get that? "rosservice call /mybot/supervisor/node/get\_field 0 translation" crashes my controller. And does the ID of the field always stay the same or does ist change?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 13:11:34
`@Marcey` , index does not really matter if you want to change the translation field (just set it to 0) and 'field' is the id of the field (you can get it with the '/supervisor/node/get\_field' function/service: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb\_supervisor\_node\_get\_field](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb_supervisor_node_get_field))

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 13:08:33
`@David Mansolino` thanks, so it says:

"uint64 field

int32 index

geometry\_msgs/Vector3 value" 

How do I translate this to a correct command line in the terminal? What are my values for field and index?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 12:56:07
`@Huey` that seems indeed a very good explanation. thank you for the feedback!

##### Huey 07/30/2019 12:55:20
thanks again  `@David Mansolino` , i gave a look on the documentation on touch sensor again to investigate the weird reading my robot is getting, and i realize that my coordinate z was not pointing towards the solid object, hence, when the robot is no longer pushing ahead further, the reading become 0. my bad.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 12:55:01
And in the supervisor doeumentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb\_supervisor\_field\_set\_sf\_vec3f](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor?tab=ros#wb_supervisor_field_set_sf_vec3f)


Hi `@Marcey`, you can find a complete list of the service type here: [http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots\_ros/html/index-msg.html](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/webots_ros/html/index-msg.html)

##### Marcey 07/30/2019 12:53:03
Hello everybody, I have question: I am using Webots with ROS but I am new to both of them. I want to use the supervisor function to change the translation of my robot using the terminal. I believe it should work with "rosservice call /mybot/supervisor/field/set\_vec3f [service-args]" but I'm struggeling with the service-arguments. Can you help me with that? Or is this a completly wrong way? üòÑ

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:56:11
Ok just forget that, was a dumb question, i could answer it myself (what i actually did). Thanks for all your information. Webots is a very great environment and you are doing a great work with it and with the community üòÉ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:51:10
No sure to understand... Webots launches its controllers as child processes. Webots can be launched from the terminal.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:49:01
Can't we just open the controller from webots ? We have to run it from terminal ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:48:07
haha, no problems, you're welcome

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:46:44

Great, nice to read this!

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:43:10

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:42:08
let me check in another example..


maybe except the box is a Robot and the type is passive..


the connector.wbt example mentionned above works with these parameters.


It seems very correct to me.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:40:13
Here is my Connector fields. (Same for the connector on the robot but with type = active) :

%end


But still , the box just fall


I did that. I added magnetic to the field model for both connector, same for the autoLock at True. I changed isLocked to be False (want to try to lock it with the controller). And then i wrote this in my controller :
%figure
![unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/565154703139405824/605695662482259968/unknown.png)
%end

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 09:34:59
Once this is done, you should explicitly call the wb\_connector\_lock() function to lock the Connector.


(other fields are implicitly set to their default values)


Connector {

  model "magnetic"

  autoLock TRUE

}


The fields to set are:


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#connector-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#connector-wbt)


you could refer to this example:


Connectors which can be lock/unlock programatically needs slightly different fields.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 09:27:44
Hi again `@Fabien Rohrer` , don't want to bother you, but when i'm looking at your example, i have some questions :



 - How can I control the connector ? I made a new controller in your world, got the device, used the enable\_presence fonction and tried to unlock with the fonction in the loop. But nothing happenned.



- Same thing when i just put the isLocked boolean false, the box still is connected to the robot. Is it normal ?



- I would like to know if there are many things to change to get symetric connector, or if it's juste the type to change ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 07:45:14
`@Huey`, you can define the response of the sensor in its lookup table ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor)) in any case make sure that the robot is still pushing agains the obstacle (you can for example verify that there are still some contact points using the view menu: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/the-user-interface#view-menu) )

You have certainly all what you need to solve your issue now (?)


- you can display the connector axis in View / Optional Rendering / Show Connector Axes

Good to know. Thanks `@David Mansolino` for helping to solve this problem üòÑ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 07:36:58
- the distanceTolerance may be increased to be sure you are in the correct threshold


- it is required to have a Solid parent with physics and bounding object in the each parents of the connectors


You should pay attention to:


Arm connector:



Connector {

  locked TRUE

  type "active"

  isLocked TRUE

  autoLock TRUE

}





Solid connector:



Connector {

  type "passive"

}


I set the connectors like this:

`@Huey`, that's normal the force sensor meseaure external forces applied to the object, the mass/size of the object itself doesn't matter, try pushing your robot against a wall/obstacle in that case you will see the value increasing.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:09:19

oh.. that s why. Thanks so much `@David Mansolino`, it looks like it s working, however, it seems like im only getting negligible readings in the beginning, so i thought maybe the box too 'light', I increase the size (mass), and im still getting 0.0, is it bcz the robot itself is too small?

i.e. at the beginning of the simulation?


What do you want to achieve exactly? To automatically snap the objects at step 0?


Ok, that's a good step.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 07:01:06
Ok my axis match but still nothing.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 06:59:09
We could look at the parameters together when we are sure this is correct..


Could you check/fix this first?


and the y axis should match


the positive z-axis of the connectors should face each other

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 06:57:05
Ooh.. Maybe is it a problem about axis


I'm trying to align them perfectly while the simulation isn't running to see if it's working, but when i run again the simulation after that, still nothing

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/30/2019 06:56:43
Please look at this figure: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/connector#connector-axis-system)


The alignment may be a source of issue, it's certainly the first thing to check.


And set their fields correctly.


You need to align them correctly.


Basically, you need to add a Connector in the arm end effector, and in your object.


Hi, yes sure.

##### Berethore 07/30/2019 06:53:51
Hi every body. I have some issues with connector... I'm trying to use your Connector interface. I'm taking the exemple you provide in Webots. But i'm trying to connect a robotic arm to a random object (a box here), nothing happenned. I put the code in my controller, i have the autoLock at True, et the model is the same for both connector... I have no idea what's wrong.. Can i have your help pls ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/30/2019 06:50:30
```java
  public void run2()
  {
    while(this.step(TIME_STEP)!=1)
    {    
      tForce=ts.getValue();
      System.out.println(" "+tForce);      
    
      double leftSpeed=1.0;
      double rightSpeed=1.0;
      
      if (tForce>0)
      {
        leftSpeed = -2.0;
        rightSpeed= -2.0;
      }
      wheels[0].setVelocity(leftSpeed);
      wheels[1].setVelocity(rightSpeed);    
    }
  }
```


Thank you for the file. The problem is that you are getting the value of the touch-sensor at the first step only, you should move the line `tForce=ts.getValue();` in the while loop, just before the print:

Hi `@Huey`, did you enable the sensor? Can you share the whole code of the controller (we can't see the part where you are enabling the sensors and getting the value in your screenshot)?

##### Huey 07/30/2019 06:35:45
Morning sunshine! 



I added a touch sensor to the robot, change the type to 'force'. During the simulation, seems like it is at constant 0 (or NaN) , is there something im missing here?

Or instead of removing `extends Robot` you can remove the `Robot robot = new Robot();` and then remove all instances off `robot.SOMETHING` and replace it with `this.SOMETHING` or just `SOMETHING`, either of the options would work


Save and build the controller and it should work


It is a code issue. Please remove the `extends Robot`


Oh wait I know the issue


Yes

Hi, i created a two wheels robot base on this tutorial. 



[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab=java](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot?tab=java)



As i was hoping to test out different function which the robot can test run on. So i modified the structure a little bit, hoping it would work.

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 11:36:03
`@Deleted User` note that what you have now it is a generic programming issue not depending on Webots. You have all the resources needed to execute the Webots commands and move the robot. You just have to structure your code correctly. To write Webots controller programs it is requried to have some programming knowledge. If you struggle with it you may also consider following some programming tutorials.

##### Deleted User 07/29/2019 10:48:18
`@Fabien Rohrer` sir please guide me.

how can i add more motions in the code you have sent me



actually when i am doing it is taking one command only.



now as stefania sir guided 



it is working but now it is working as i send the above message


`@Stefania Pedrazzi`


it is working sir



but now one problem arises

when I am pressing the forward motion after that only the turn left command is working and it is working for the single time only

and if i need to turn it more i have to first go forward then only turning command is working

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 10:21:00
yes. from `wbu_motion_play` to `while (! wbu_motion_is_over(forwards))` you are running the forward motion. To run the turn left you have to execute the same instructions.

##### Deleted User 07/29/2019 10:19:08
so you are saying agin i have to give a while loop after   } while (! wbu\_motion\_is\_over(forwards));

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 10:17:57
to turn left after going forward you have to add it just after the `do..while`. 

But I strongly suggest you to try to understand your code and play with it by moving the instructions at different position in the code and see what happens.

##### Deleted User 07/29/2019 10:14:39
here i have given wbu motion is over command for forward motion



where should i add the turn left command


while (true) {

    // Wait until the Up key is pushed

    printf("Select the robot and press the up button go forward\n");

    while (wb\_robot\_step(time\_step) != -1) {

      if (wb\_keyboard\_get\_key() == WB\_KEYBOARD\_UP)

        break; // stop waiting

    }



    // Run the simulator while the motion is not over.

    wbu\_motion\_play(forwards);  // Start the walk motion.



    do {

      double time = wb\_robot\_get\_time(); // get the simulated time in seconds.

      wb\_motor\_set\_position(RShoulderPitch, 1.2 + 0.3 * sin(-5.0 * time)); // move the elbow according to a sinusoidal function.

      wb\_motor\_set\_position(LShoulderPitch, (1.2 + 0.3 * sin(5.0 * time)));

      wb\_robot\_step(time\_step);

    } while (! wbu\_motion\_is\_over(forwards));

  }

  

  return 0;

}

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 09:54:21
`@Deleted User` you have to wait until the first motion is over before starting the next one, otherwise the second motion commands will overwrite the first one.

Please look at the `wbu_motion_is_over` documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion#wbu\_motion\_is\_over](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion#wbu_motion_is_over)

here is also a sample controller showing how to use it: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao\_wave\_hand/nao\_wave\_hand.c](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/softbank/nao/controllers/nao_wave_hand/nao_wave_hand.c)

i added the below code, it is not showing any error, the file compiled successfully



but when i  am putting the turn left movement above the forward movement the robot is only taking the turning left command.

##### Huey 07/29/2019 06:49:46
Thanks `@MariusJuston` , like you said, I added 'group' instead of 'shape' and playing with it a little bit, and slowly understand what you mean! 



and Thanks `@David Mansolino`  for pin pointing out the tutorial and documentation! They are really helpful! üôá  I shall take a look at them

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/29/2019 06:42:54
Note also that to prevent the robot from swaying during motion we ususally use a sphere(which can be partially 'inside' the robot) this is more efficient to simulate, and we set the ContactProperties.coulombFriction to a very low value to make the contact between the sphere and the ground frictionless ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties))


`@Huey`, `@MariusJuston` is completely right, you should use a group, please have a look at this tutorial showing something very similar: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes-15-minutes](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorial-5-compound-solid-and-physics-attributes-15-minutes)

You can instead of making the bounding object just a simple shape, you can make it into a group and then add as many shapes as you want

Hi, I have a question about boundingObject. To prevent the robot from swaying during motion. 



(video)



I have added a cone shape point (touching the ground) (a polulu ball caster like device would have been ideal, but might be complex to build?)



(images)



Is it possible to set boundingObject to take more than one Shape?

PROTO nameEqualsToFileName [ field ... ]


Inside the .proto file, you need to change the name too:


the PROTO name should match with the filename.

##### Huey 07/26/2019 13:35:14
however, i did the changing filename too, but still getting this error msg: v14:36: error: Skipped unknown 'MatteGreyConcrete' node or PROTO.


your solution is much more straightforward, i wll use that


I was fidgeting with the floorAppearance and somehow got sucked into the blackhole


LOL... indeed... doi me

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/26/2019 13:32:52
RectangleArena.floorAppearance PBRAppearance { baseColor 1 0 0}


By the way, your solution seems quite complexe. Instead of creating a PROTO for this, you could simply use the PBRAppearance node:


Did you rename the proto name inside the MatteGreyConcrete.proto ?


It should work too.

##### Huey 07/26/2019 13:26:54
Oh i didn't, instead I put the MatteGreyConcrete.proto in the Webots\projects\appearances\protos

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/26/2019 13:24:57
YOUR\_PROJECT/protos/MatteGreyConcrete.proto?


This is possible, you should be close from a solution. Did you put your new file in the "protos" directory?

##### Huey 07/26/2019 13:23:38
May I asked if that's not allowed? Or any other way i could change the floor texture map into a plain color?


Hi, I try to change the RectangleArena into a plain color. So, I made a copy of the RectangleArena.proto and 'save as' a different file under my project protos folder. 



Subsequently, I created new proto file, MatteGreyConcrete.proto  in Webots\projects\appearances\protos

then change: field SFNode     floorAppearance to MatteGreyConcrete {} inside the new RectangleArena.proto file



 That s when i get the error message: /protos/RectangleArenaPlain.proto':14:36: error: Skipped unknown 'MatteGreyConcrete' node or PROTO.

But Webots supports basic fluids like in this demo:


In my Mavic simulation, I only set some global damping.


To go further than Propellers, fluid can be simulated too, in a basic way.


I'm about to release a demo movie on youTube about this.


Here is some doc: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mavic-2-pro?version=revision](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/mavic-2-pro?version=revision)

GREAT!!!

It's a model of the DJI Mavic 2 PRO:


It's already in our revision branch, but not released on a stable release.


Funny enough, I'm currently working on a better drone demo.


It shows 3 different designs of helicopter. This is definitively a good starting point.


You may find an example of the Propeller use here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#propeller-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#propeller-wbt)


(a controllable and customizable force and torque applied on some solid)


It allows to simulate a thrust.

The most important node to master is the Propeller node:

`@Deleted User` I allow myself to enter in the discussion. We saw your same question here several times and on several other threads too (youTube comments, private messages, etc.) .

`@Deleted User` The shoulder is not moving because the motion file does not contain any value for the shoulders, if you want them to move you have to either use another motion file or modify this motion file to add shoulder value.

But I want to ask where can I change the resolutions to ~50%?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2019 06:28:13
`@MariusJuston` , I just thought about one possible workaround (but this requires to have a bit of knowledge of rhe PROTO mechanism: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)). The idea would be tu use a procedural boolean field to determine of the physics node should be present or not (and switch this field from the supervisor API)

How to connect webot with choreograph?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/24/2019 06:17:29
`@MariusJuston`, unfortunately I don't see any simple solution, we are indeed missing a `wb_supervisor_field_remove_sf` and `wb_supervisor_field_import_sf_node` function. Maybe someone else has an idea for a workaroud ?


`@Chen-moon` , thank you for the bug report, I did indeed saw it. We don't have any headset available right now, but we will try as soon as we have it back and let you know.

In the meantime, I saw that you have a HTC Vive Pro (I did try only with the HTC Vive for now), can you try reducing the resolution to ~50% (this is feasible in the preferences of SteamVR, then you have to restart Webots once changed)?

Hi Sharavan, yes you can add a 'runtime.ini' file in the same directory than your controller. This is documented here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#languages-settings](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/controller-programming#languages-settings)

##### ShravanTata 07/22/2019 12:30:14
Hi Cyberbotics, Is there a way to launch Webots with a particular python command to run the controller instead of setting it globally in the preferences?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/22/2019 06:22:02
`@MerySgh`, `@MariusJuston` is completely right, since each one (the car and the robot) is using its own seperated controller you should be able to have one of them in C (which you need to compile) and on of them in PYthon (which of course doesn't need to be compiled, but please make sure you have correctly setup Python: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-python)).

However, if you want one (or more) of the pedestrian to be a 'static' passenger of the car, it is strongly recommended to put it's 'controller' field to `""`, or you can use the 'MotorbikeDriver' ([https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/protos/generic/MotorbikeDriver.proto](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/vehicles/protos/generic/MotorbikeDriver.proto)), which is already in the correct position (but in that case it should be 'encapsulated' in a Slot node: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/slot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/slot))


`@Deleted User` The shoulder is not moving because the motion file does not contain any value for the shoulders, if you want them to move you have to either use another motion file or modify this motion file to add shoulder value. For more information about motion files please refer to: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motion-functions)


Hi `@Nora`, please use the technical-questions' for futur questions.

About omnidirectional wheels the simplest (and most efficient solution) is to use asymetric friction (this can be defined in the Worldinfo.contactproperties field). Please have a look at these examples where the youbot robot uses this mechanism: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot#samples](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot#samples)

##### Nora 07/21/2019 16:39:17
hello, excuse me i new in the webots world and Im trying to create omnidirecctional wheels with rollers at 45 degrees, can anybody help me?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/21/2019 14:58:30
Just press the run button like usual

##### MerySgh 07/21/2019 14:58:03
So how can i do it ?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/21/2019 14:21:55
`@MerySgh` You should still be able to run the simulation... and edit them, the controllers are compiled separately from each other

##### Deleted User 07/21/2019 05:21:50
NAO robot, shoulder pitch not working. It is walking using  nao\_demo code but hand is still at one place.

Please solve it.

I need to make it walk like we do (moving hand while walking)

I tried to add a pedestrian from  files .... but the problem is the city is programmed in C while pedestrian is programmed in python ... so I can't compile the two files


I work on webots for a project of the autonomous vehicles and I have to do like simulation a car in the road which strikes a pedestrians according to precise attacks .... so far I have just realized a city with a car above .. now I have to add a few passengers but I don't know how to do it


Hello is there someone here ?

Hi, the simplest solution is to save your world and open the world file in your text editor, this way you will see the format of all the nodes you have in the 'children' field, you can simply copy paste the content of the 'children' field from your world file to your PROTO file.

##### Huey 07/17/2019 17:05:56
scene tree, these are the children

`@Akash` I'm currently adding a better example for the Accelerometer node: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/pull/730](https://github.com/omichel/webots/pull/730) Any feedback would be welcome üòÉ

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:54:28
OK...

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:54:01
No it does not work for either: `C:\Users\***\Anaconda3\envs\***\python.exe state_controller/state_controller.py`. For `C:\Users\***\Anaconda3\envs\***\pythonw.exe state_controller/state_controller.py` it does not print anything even though there are print statements, so i am assuming that it is not working

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:51:35
Also, can you try to launch your python controller from a DOS CMD by typing "python my\_controller.py" in the controller folder?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:48:37
sadly no...

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:40:59
Last thing to try: could try to use pythonw.exe (instead of python.exe) to execute your robot controller? It seems that makes a difference in some cases.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:35:23
No problems, thank you very much for the time that you have sent trying to help me! I really appreciate it!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:34:45
But I don't time right now (I am flying to China very soon).


I believe the next step would be for me to install PyCharm and try from there.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:33:37
is there anything I could provide you in order to help you troubleshoot?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:32:28
So, I don't understand why it doesn't work from your PyCharm environment...


For me it also works from a DOS console.


OK.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:19:04
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 24 2019, 15:29:51) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:18:34
Are you sure you have a 64 bit python?


I will now try from a DOS console...


I could follow the instructions and launch my python controller from a MSYS2 console without any problem.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:08:58
here are the returns of `sys.path` for when it is run on Webots and PyCharm respectively:

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:05:25
Let me try it.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:04:48
Again I have setup all the environmental variables (except for the Python PYTHONPATH and PYTHONENCODING because I am using an env) for Windows, WEBOTS\_HOME and added mingw64 to the environment. It still does not work... same old error

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 15:00:15
So, it is correct to set it to C:\Users***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots in your case.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 15:00:00
makes sense

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:59:39
Yes, that's because you installed Webots for a single user (without administrator privileges).

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:58:30
By the way the documentation for that table is probably outdated becasue for windows it is saying that the WEBOTS\_HOME directory is at C:\Program Files\Webots when it is actually: C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:55:13
(there was an extra question mark making my previous link wrong)


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:54:44
Sorry I did not see the link

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:54:27
They are all documented on the web page I pointed out.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:54:07
Would you be so kind as to inform me of what they are please?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:52:29
There is quite a large number of environment variables to setup.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:52:08
Still no... 
```bash
echo %WEBOTS_HOME%
C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\
```

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:51:31
Did you follow the instructions here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?)


No, you should do it yourself.


Yes.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:45:40
I do not have the WEBOTS\_HOME environmental variable is that something I should set (I am in Windows)? Am I supposed to do that myself or is the installer supposed to do that?


I can see it in `sys.path` though


yes

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:41:21
Do you get the same error?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:41:05
`@Olivier Michel`  Still does not work even when I added it to my Path environmental variable


Will do!

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:38:05
Then, can you try to add this path to your "Path" environment variable?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:37:13
`@Olivier Michel` it seems that it is still doing the same thing...

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/16/2019 14:04:19
So that Python will be able to load the Controller.dll library.


C:\\Users\\***\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Webots\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin


Hi Marius, you probably need to add another path:

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/16/2019 14:02:07
the path you are including is indeed correct and should contain all the Python3 stuff. I will just check this to confirm it.


Yes, it seems to be a DLL or path issue.


Hi Marius,

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/16/2019 13:57:51
Hello, good gentlemen's i am trying to run a python controller from PyCharm without needing to run Webots. The problem is that it says that: 

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/***/Documents/GitHub/***/***/controllers/state_controller/state_controller.py", line 40, in <module>
    from controller import Supervisor, Motor
  File "C:\Users\***\AppData\Local\Programs\Webots\lib\python37\controller.py", line 17, in <module>
    import _controller
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
```

I am trying to load the DLLs; however, I have not managed to find them. I have added `'C:\\Users\\***\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Webots\\lib\\python37'` to my `sys.path` variable already.

What can I do to make this work?

Many thanks!

Please check in your file system that "PATH\_TO\_YOUR\_CONTROLLER/../../motions/Forwards50.motion" exists, if not, copy-paste it.


The motion file cannot be found, therefore, forwards == NULL.


WbMotionRef forwards = wbu\_motion\_new("../../motions/Forwards50.motion");


You have this error because of this line:

i am pressing the forward button in Nao\_demo.c controller, it is moving forward but hand is not moving.



What i need is, when i press the forwars button it should move along with moving the hand.


I was working on it for about 2 and half hours 

But unable to get the resulf üòî 



Sir my objective is simple



I want the same control as in Nao\_demo.c



I want to make it walk when i press the button as mentioned in demo code. 

The only thing i am not getting is the hand movement as we do.



I need to control it by pressing the button 

Means it should move when i press the button along with the shoulder pitch

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 17:50:56
It could be explained if the path to ¬´¬†Forwards50.motion¬†¬ª is wrong. Could you check this file exists? It is defined relatively to your controller directory.

You may find values for these constants in order to match with the gait.


AMPLITUDE * sin(FREQUENCY * time) + OFFSET


In the code I sent you, the shoulder is actuated by a sin() function. You could play with this by adding constants, for example:

In the motion file you are playing, probably that the hands are not actuated. When a motion is played, you can still use the wb\_motor\_set\_position() on the arm motors. Could this be a solution for you?

##### Deleted User 07/15/2019 10:59:42
During motion of NAO, hands are kept stable it is not moving, like we move our hand. When it is moving forward or backward hand are kept stable 

Shoulder pitch  motor is not working in NAO (i think)

I have attached the picture,

it is in this position for all the time.

The default lookupTable does not do any interpolation.


lookupTable []


So, to have the values of an accelerometer without alterating it, you could define a lookupTable like this:


You may find here how a lookup table is working: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor#lookup-table)


The lookupTable, is simply a function converting the vector in m/s^2 (typically [0, -9.81, 0]) to something else. It is applied on each channel independently.

##### Akash 07/15/2019 09:57:36
What should be the values of lookup table  for accelerometer and how could i convert it to m/s^2 from vector values?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 09:40:40
Is it sufficient?


In WEBOTS\_HOME/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/worlds/e-puck\_cross-compilation.wbt the accelerometer is used to analyse the slope inclination, the most bottom led is enabled accordingly.


Let me check..


Hi, yes, many.

##### Akash 07/15/2019 09:36:16
Is there any example file in webots, where the accelerometer is been used?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/15/2019 04:42:26
We are trying to carry a duty period out during business hours (European time). Out of this period, answers may come with a certain delay üòâ


This function calls the wb\_robot\_step() function several times until reaching the expected time (in seconds) It is based on the wb\_robot\_get\_time() function. You should obviously stop the motors before calling ¬´¬†wait\_a\_while¬†¬ª.


You could take a copy-paste the ¬´¬†wait\_a\_while¬†¬ª function (and the required ¬´¬†step¬†¬ª function defined above) in your code: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/kinematics/tinkerbots/controllers/crane/crane.c#L33](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/kinematics/tinkerbots/controllers/crane/crane.c#L33)

I'm programming in C, I think I need a function that kinda stops the robot a little bit when I set velocities to 0 and then after some time the robot turns right, I have the two functions, the one that stops the robot and the one that turns the robot, however since the loop is so fast I don't know how to simulate that 'STOP'

Last week I was working with my three wheels omnidirectional robot that I created,  so far I've programmed it into two mode (manual and autonomous), so far so good, the issue is when in the autonomous mode, when I detect an obstacle through a distance sensor I want my robot to stop and THEN, if the obstacle is more to the left TURN the robot to the right, however I don't know how to make the robot  wait a little bit stopped a little bit and then turn the robot

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/12/2019 14:01:06
You can add noise on the position-senors too, the speed can be retrieved, etc. all the functionnalities are also available.


I am sorry but this node is deprecated, it is highly recommended to use the regular robot node instead (and the e-puck model has been updated accordingly)

##### R\_LCL 07/12/2019 13:58:59
I was referring to this one: ‚Üí [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/differentialwheels](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/differentialwheels). Since it has some of the functions that I need for my project. (slipNoise, speed, etc)

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/12/2019 13:52:14
(which you can then derive to get the speed)


Hi, I am not sure to understand your question, the e-puck robot is already a differential wheel, you should simply use its position-sensors to get the wheel position.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:32:26
`@MerySgh` So a Python Interpreter is what contains the python.exe and contains all the libraries and dependencies associated with it (as far as I understand it).

A virtual environment in python is useful if you have multiple projects and these projects differ. Such a vision processing project and a text editor project. As you can imagine these for two projects you would need very different libraries. If you used a single interpreter you would have to install the libraries to a single python interpreter, meaning that each project would contain both python projects libraries because they are both referencing the same interpreter and you are installing the libraries to a single interpreter. If you use virtual environments it copies over to a new folder a "clean" copy of your python base interpreter as a separate environment. In the previous example, you would create 2 virtual environments: one for the vision processing project and one for the text editor project. That would allow you to install the libraries for the vision processing project and which would only be available to that project and same with the text editor libraries and environment. This allows your python interpreters to be more lightweight and usually makes it easier for IDEs, you also delete these virtual environments without needing to reinstall Python, etc... (this is how I understand it)

I personally really like Anaconda for creating virtual environments and PyCharm as my Python IDE. Anaconda and PyCharm make it very easy to install libraries and create virtual environments for your projects. (this is of course just my opinion there are plenty more of other IDE and Virtual environment options)


No problems. I will be sure to clarify as much as I can.

##### MerySgh 07/12/2019 02:15:29
mmmmm ok I will try, I'm sorry if you don't understand quickly it's because I'm still beginner I trying to  be adapted to these technical words

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:12:42
`@MerySgh`  If you think that you are only going to be using a single Python interpreter for all your projects/worlds it might just be easier for you to place your python path as an environmental variable.


`@MerySgh`  No sorry about that it seems that I was not very clear. That was a Python command. You can open up your python console and run those commands to give you the location. When you install Python it comes with  IDLE search for that and then run the command

you're probably not using a virtual environment if you're not programming in an ide

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/12/2019 02:07:24
Paste that in the  Python command field


This will give you the Python path of you running python.exe

make sure to restart webots after making changes to your environment variables


ideally, changing the environment variable will work, but it can be tricky


the first thing you should try is adding PYTHONPATH as an environment variable: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/4855685](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4855685)

then if you're having more trouble, go into Tools>Preferences and change the python command to the python executable. mine is:

sounds good

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:27:08
You should probably try reproducing the problem in a minimalistic example (e.g. just two DOF) and post an issue with this example on github: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/new/choose)


But the bit of code you sent seems correct, this should work

##### ThundrHawk 07/11/2019 19:25:33
makes sense

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:25:22
Using thread should not help because in any case the simulation time will increase only when you call the robot step function.

##### ThundrHawk 07/11/2019 19:24:15
I've tried running those functions with the threading library to the same results. I could be doing something wrong with that, though


we may be using it wrong, but we're running this bit of code:

```python
for motor, position in zip(motors, positions):
    motor.setPosition(position)
    motor.setVelocity(MAX_V)
```

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 19:18:51
Yes how they do it is that they use setPosition in very small intervals

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:18:14
Here is for example a robot arm controlled in Webots: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq0-DkEwwj4)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 19:17:46
No it does not seem so

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:17:19
You should be able to call the setPosition for each motor at the same step and they should move all in parallel isn't it the case?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 19:14:14
I understand that; however, I am using a 6 DOF robot arm and I want to make the joints in sync and thus make the motion seem smooth, with the setPosition it is very choppy because it is moving the motors sequentially.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 19:04:00
`@MariusJuston` , the idea is actually to use both the setPosition and setVelocity function, the first sets the target position and the second defines the maximum allowed velocity to reach this target position.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 18:47:07
setVelocity is nice and all but if possible I would like to use setPosition to make my life easier. Is there a way to multi-thread setPosition?


`@R_LCL` it seems that you are retrieving your velocity at initialization when the robot is not moving. If you want to retrieve the velocities continuously you want to use the getVelocity method inside the while loop

##### R\_LCL 07/11/2019 17:55:59
Hello, I need help with the getVelocity() function. I used the getFromDef function and assigned it to my robot. But, as you can see in the  attached picture, the velocity values that I'm getting are all zeroes. May I know what am I doing wrong?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 14:30:16
Ok, thank you for the feedback, that sounds indeed like a very good reason.

##### ThundrHawk 07/11/2019 14:29:16
We figured it out. We had set the position to infinity when we grabbed them from the supervisor, but we hadn't set their velocity to 0 at that time. We only did it after they had already moved a bit.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 14:18:06
The position sensors will return the value of the jointparameter.position field (if any) is it not the case ?

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/11/2019 14:08:00
Thank you. Sorry again but I seem to have some issues with the PositionSensors, I have not moved the robot yet and the values the sensors are returning to me are not 0. I assume that that is not normal. Is there a way to reset/zero the sensor?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/11/2019 06:22:46
`@MariusJuston` about the boxes collision, the simplest solution is probably to add a touchSensors ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/touchsensor)) to your robot arm.

##### speedy6451 07/10/2019 23:16:52

##### ThundrHawk 07/10/2019 22:43:21
you just have to write it in a new language and tell the robot to use that one

##### speedy6451 07/10/2019 22:42:53
How do you change the language of a robot controller?

##### ThundrHawk 07/10/2019 22:42:19
If you use set velocity, they'll move at the same time. you would just then have to figure out when to stop then

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/10/2019 22:19:40
Hello is there a simple way to make a robot arm move smoothly? When I use setPosition on the joints it is very choppy because it seems that it is moving the joints sequentially.

In this movie (at time = 71s), we can see an older version of the youBot with the subwheels entirely modeled: [https://youtu.be/vFwNwT8dZTU?t=71](https://youtu.be/vFwNwT8dZTU?t=71) but this has been dropped to use the asymmetric friction in newer versions.


When implementing the youBot, I have done lot of tests related to this, and the second solution (the one used by the youBot) is much more accurate, robust and quick to solve of our physics engine.


Or you could use the asymmetric friction (cf. WorldInfo.contactProperties.coulombFriction ) to simulate sub wheels, like in the Kuka youbot robot: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/youbot)

No, it only stores the target position, you should use the position sensor associated to the same joint that the motor

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/08/2019 15:57:19

Thank you very much for helping


Ok I see

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:56:55
the guide you mention is done for the Nao only


Unfortunately, there is not pepper robot 3d model in Webots

##### OnlyPtuuu 07/08/2019 13:45:01
I think that work with pepper


[http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-4/software/webots/webots\_index.html#webots-launching](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-4/software/webots/webots_index.html#webots-launching) 

I want only use one robot like this guide

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:42:12
And to use the Webots2blender addon to import it in Webots:  [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)


A good strategy would be to find a good 3D model of the Pepper, for example here: [https://www.turbosquid.com/fr/3d-model/softbank-robotics](https://www.turbosquid.com/fr/3d-model/softbank-robotics)


Modeling a humanoid robot model is not a simple task. And it depends on your skills, your input data, etc.

##### OnlyPtuuu 07/08/2019 13:37:54
And how can I do?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:36:46
Ok, just to warn you Webots does not contain a Pepper model.

##### OnlyPtuuu 07/08/2019 13:35:57
I would like to use webots to simulate pepper and test my projects

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:34:30
What about pepper? Do you have a model of this robot in Webots?


This project is no more supported by Cyberbotics nor SoftBanks, sorry for this.


Yes this may be not obvious, I'm not sure about the current state of this project.

##### OnlyPtuuu 07/08/2019 13:33:12

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:32:27
that sounds to be a good idea üëçüèª

##### OnlyPtuuu 07/08/2019 13:31:28
Ok now I install last version R2019B

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:29:56
Webots is free and open-source since R2019a.


Ok, I think you can use the latest version, it will solves more issues than others. However, in recent Webots versions, you have to install naoqisim by yourself from this deprecated repo: [https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim](https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim)

##### OnlyPtuuu 07/08/2019 13:28:02
Do you advice downloading the latest version?


Because in aldebaran documentation say to use this version

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/08/2019 13:26:45

`@NearMonzter` From SolidWork, you can export a VRML or X3D file, and then you can import it in Webots as a Shape (the graphical info only). Alternatively, you can use Blender inbetween and add more information (collisions, masses, joints, etc.), using this addon: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)

OK...

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:59:21
yeah we stuck it in a try except to make pycharm happy

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:37:01
Maybe you should configure PyCharm so that it searches for modules in the current folder as well.


No problem, you are welcome.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:36:14
thanks for your help


alright it looks like that works. I suppose I was confused because I'm using PyCharm for the coding, and it's telling me it can't find the module

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:35:05
Yes.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:34:29
your constants.py file is in the same folder?


thanks


alright

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:33:10
Well, something standard in Webots.


which is a subfolder of the controllers directory.


And my supervisor.py is stored into a folder called "supervisor".


Sorry, yes it is important (I did get your question).

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:31:58
alright thanks i'll see if that works

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:31:49
Yes, but this should make no difference.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:31:32
and you have your robot's controller set to "supervisor"?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:31:10
and it works.


from supervisor.py, I simply "import constants"


I have another python file called constants.py


my main python file is called supervisor.py

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:30:36
how did you set it up?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/05/2019 15:30:28
I don't have a runtime.ini file.


I am currently writing a python controller split in several files.

##### ThundrHawk 07/05/2019 15:29:34
does anyone know if there's a way to fix this or if I have to do everything in the one controller file?


and it tells me that there is no parent directory set up


and I use imports with the following method:

```python
from .utils import *
```


I'm trying to create a python controller, and I'm trying to create other python files alongside the controller file to reduce clutter. I've been changing my runtime.ini file to :

```ini
[python]
OPTIONS = -m demo_controller
```

[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)


Hi Marius, yes heavy robots can ¬´¬†sink¬†¬ª with the default physics parameters. Rather than changing the masses, you should rather modify the ContactProperties softCFM value.

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/03/2019 18:49:28
I seem to have figured out the problem, objects a rest sink in the ground by default because of their weights. I will just make the weight of the objects very little and it should work


Hello I seem to be having some issues, I have a custom made part that was created from inventor, exported as an .stl, converted using blender into a .wrl and then imported into Webots. When it is imported into Webots it is depicted as a Shape so I copy pasted it into a Solid object, because the shape was complex I just used a Box as a bounding object; however, the origin point was not in the center of the part so I had to wrap the Box with a Transform object. When I start the simulation the object just sinks into the ground a few centimeters. I have tried changing the basicTimStep, and the ERP but I have had no success.

##### nisuunn 07/03/2019 11:38:03
Thanks for the help!


But, I think maybe I can work out some way around this.


In my case I cannot connect the supervisor to my robot, as the supervisor spawns a new robot so there would be an endless loop of spawning new robots.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/03/2019 11:35:41
so you could refer simply to the receiver doc: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/receiver)


You could simply add your Receiver as a child of the supervisor. (a supervisor is a Robot with the supervisor field enabled; it acts the same as a robot controller, but access to supplementary functions).

##### nisuunn 07/03/2019 11:30:25
Hi! I would like to send data with an emitter from a robot controller script to a supervisor. Where should the supervisor's receiver be and how can I access the receiver with the Supervisor?

okay I understand, thanks Olivier

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:23:32
We don't have much experience in running Webots on such computer clusters.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:22:48
before I jump into that


does in your experience parallelization work fine?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:21:45
So, I have no clue on what could be the bottleneck, you should investigate it on your cluster.


OK, so it shouldn't be the problem.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:20:41
but no self collision


I use accelerometer, imu, gyro, position sensors, force sensors and 3 type of motors

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:20:28
All these rely on OpenGL acceleration.


Do you use camera, lidar or range finders in your simulations?

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:19:36
yes, they all are run in fast mode

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:19:27
Did you try to run the simulation in fast mode?


If your cloud has no graphics hardware acceleration, this could be the bottleneck.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:19:03
so I don't see graphics


i fast forward all simulations


the controllers are basically just getting observations from the sensors, feeding this through a tensorflow graph and then actuating the motors

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 10:18:38
It could be the graphics.

##### El\_Samu\_El 07/03/2019 10:17:43
It is run on Ubuntu 18.04 without a gpu


I have a question about parallel execution of several webots instances. It seems like parallel execution does not really give any significant speedup. I have access to a cloud instance with 96 cores and around 360 GB RAM. When I launch 40 webots instances to run 100 timesteps each, then this is not (significantly) faster then running 4000 timesteps on a single instance on my local 8GB machine.  I open the instances via the subprocess module of python. They do in fact all run in parallel, but the more instances I start, the slower each of them gets. Where is the bottleneck? Do all of them use shared ressources?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 07/03/2019 06:00:15
`@Gabriel_martinez` to read the keyboard input from a controller you have to use the Keyboard API: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard#wb\_keyboard\_get\_key](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/keyboard#wb_keyboard_get_key).

In the `projects/languages` folder you can find an example of controller written in C++, Java, and Python. For a C example please look at the `samples/devices/worlds/gps.wbt` simulation.

This is my imput to the command line:  "rosservice call /myBot/supervisor/node/get\_position "node: 0""



"node: 0" is obviously wrong, but what would be the right argument? Or am I completely misusing the supervisor functions?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 07/01/2019 06:47:52
`@MariusJuston` Do you have any possibility to export your file to something else than a *.iam? Blender supports better other formats like *.x3d, *.collada, etc. To set the joints/sensors, please refer to the README here: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter) If you don't want to use the addon, you can indeed import the wrl shapes (it's regular it's a list)  directly into a new Solid node (by copy-pasting the Shapes into the new Solid.children fields).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 07/01/2019 06:47:35
`@MohamedSabry`, this is probably caused by an incompatible library in your PATH, can you please try to delete the file 'protofile\_matlab\_2018b\_webots\_R2019a.m' in your temporary files and then retry (this file will be regenerated by Webots).

For more information, please have a look at this issue (exact same problem): [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/63](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues/63)

##### MariusJuston [Moderator] 07/01/2019 01:12:47
Sorry, I have been trying to set up my robot *.iam file through Blender and I have not managed to figure out how to do it. I have managed to export the file as a *.wrl; however, I have no idea how I would actually set it up in Webots, it is a simple 6 axis robot however how do you set up a custom robot from a custom .wrl? 

Also, how do you set up the joints and the sensors, if you have to do it through Blender how would you do this? 

On another note I am trying to import another model to be an object that the robot would need to interact with, again I have the *.iam and I have managed to convert it to a *.wrl; however, when I import the created *.wrl from the Webots Import VRML97 functionality I get a big list of Shape objects, how do I group them into a single Solid?

Many thanks!

##### MohamedSabry 06/30/2019 14:41:56

Maybe you can try to switch from double to float to save some memory.


The memory on the first generation of e-pucks is really limited, it is highly probable that the matrice is too big for the e-puck memory.

when I try a different project it works fine. This project uses some matrices which are 16*16 containing doubles which are weights for a simple neural net, nothing massive. and the compiled file is only 19.2 kB

Basically you can remove any node in the simulation using this function: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_node\_remove](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_node_remove)

And add a new node with these ones: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb\_supervisor\_field\_import\_mf\_node](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor#wb_supervisor_field_import_mf_node)

Hello. I am trying to implement a Deep Q Network in a webots environment. What i need to do,is "change" the robot after an amount of steps,with a seemingly new one. I dont want to reset the controller,since i dont want to lose the progress of the training. I have seen that there is a way to remove a robot via a supervisor command,but how can i instantly re-import it so it's like a new one? I want to do that,since after a number of steps and collisions,the robot is damaged and not functioning properly

Probably size of these buttons is too small, and when you make padding it eat from first letter small portion of pixels. Its create red color because of some semi-transparency shits  or something of the sort.


Suggestion: First try to make the buttons bigger, `@David Mansolino`


I really don't understand nothing from Qt and making GUI with it, nor from Qt The Style Sheet but this is your problem.


This mean: go to your Qt Editor, and check Button Controls Options  for all Dialogs they are the same and if they differ, by what options exactly.


...create the problem. But with padding 1px 1px in one dialog problem resolve in other with default buttons the problem persist.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/28/2019 07:11:31
Ok, thank you for the suggestion, if you want you can try to do a prototype and submit it to our github repo, the css of the dark mode is defined here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/resources/webots\_night.qss](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/resources/webots_night.qss) (night) or [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/resources/webots\_dusk.qss](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/resources/webots_dusk.qss) (dusk)

##### Emil Enchev 06/28/2019 07:09:42

I like dark. If you want simply put little purple dot outside of the caption to indicate focus something like this, but coloration on part of text is worse.

There is indeed an issue with the first letter, we are aware of this, if it is irritating you, you can switch to the 'classic' them, the problem should not be present in this theme.

##### Emil Enchev 06/28/2019 06:59:11
For me it look like some sort of graphical defect. It disrupts the perception of the first letter and is irritating. The purple border is sufficient to indicate focus.

0.001


Set it to minimum and see what will be result


Do you understand me `@Akash` . Probably your basicTimeStep was increased, and this is why you read wrong information from sensors.


the problems of others can become mine too


I'm totally newbie here this is why ask you


"Setting this field to a high value will accelerate the simulation, but will decrease the accuracy and the stability, especially for physics computations and collision detection. It is usually recommended to tune this value in order to find a suitable speed/accuracy trade-off." What is your value of  basicTimeStep

##### Akash 06/27/2019 16:28:42
Ok, thank you.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 16:27:13
The wb\_distance\_sensor\_get\_sampling\_period function returns the period given into the wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable function, or 0 if the device is disabled.


and


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/distancesensor)

The wb\_distance\_sensor\_enable function allows the user to enable distance sensor measurements. The sampling\_period argument specifies the sampling period of the sensor and is expressed in milliseconds. Note that the first measurement will be available only after the first sampling period elapsed.

##### Akash 06/27/2019 16:25:12
`@Emil Enchev`  No its not the code, its like when the robot is at 90 degree the  compass is reading it 43.(something) degree,  same thing is happening to the distance sensor. I can stretch the values of compass response array to 90 degree by adding  some increasing variable to each and every value in that array, but nothing can be done to the distancesensor's array values.

The basicTimeStep field defines the duration of the simulation step executed by Webots. It is a floating point value expressed in milliseconds. The minimum value for this field is 0.001, that is, one microsecond. Setting this field to a high value will accelerate the simulation, but will decrease the accuracy and the stability, especially for physics computations and collision detection. It is usually recommended to tune this value in order to find a suitable speed/accuracy trade-off.

##### Akash 06/27/2019 16:12:43
`@Fabien Rohrer`  reducing the time  WorldInfo.basicTimeStep is just giving me a lot more number of values but not proper values.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 16:09:22
Or you mean, that you want most fast to build the map?


Do you mean you check them too often, and this is time consuming  slowing down your remaining code?

##### Akash 06/27/2019 16:02:37
`@Emil Enchev`   Because I am using distance sensors and compass to map surrounding just as a Lidar, Because of circular dynamic motion of the bot the response  distance sensors and compass are giving back are not proper (I don't want to use Lidar).

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 15:38:23
`@Akash` what is your problem exactly? Why you want to increase response of these sensors?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 15:33:00
`@Akash` I hope it answers your question.


.. typically by a integer multiple of WorldInfo.basicTimeStep


Then each sensor refresh rate can be set indepently using the "wb\_sensor\_enable" function


The minimum refresh interval is given by WorldInfo.basicTimeStep


Hi

##### Akash 06/27/2019 15:30:25
Is there any way by which the DistanceSensor's or the Compass's rate of response can be increase (decreasing the response time interval) ?

When Softbank give you NAOs for rent, I will build the best protection system for them, to compensate some your repair costs. Bending knee is passive action of protection. There are active moves during impact which will compensate more.

I think it was an hot topic at robocup at some point, you may find literature there.


I read a paper once about to bend the knees in case of fall, this prevents lot of impact forces.


For sure, there are simple ways to prevent breaks

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 15:20:46
Detect what position fall, and move head in other direction, after impact will compensate with slight moving to the flor to reduce impact forces

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 15:20:13

HeadPitch and HeadYaw will be enough for me

`@bing feng` At some point you need to switch to Webots (if you would like). Creating animation in robotics is not the best idea because very rigid. You could for example try to actuate the motors with sinus/cosinus, it's a good way to start. Take a look at our mantis.wbt example, for example.

And `@Fabi`en , I think that if you arrange one big room with 4-5 NAO robots. One man can maintain them and help renting people if there is some minor problems, like robot fall and stuck or something like that. As `@bing feng` propose 5 Euro on Hour will be good enough for renting people and  even money will remain for the salary of the supporting NAO's person. Everything will be fine.  First, Softbank will stretch a little bit, because they will think it will hurt their business with the sale of robots of universities but in reality students do not pay anyway for using them.  Renting Online will only bring new users to them. The will give you NAO for free, be sure, if they have some brains in a heads.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:07:50
tell me which software u used and show me the python code, the bug is patched, its not illegal to possess that code so send it

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:07:45
you believe me or not.


Its not matter, as I said it.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:06:59
ye no i still dont believe u at all

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:06:00
And ask them whey they don't arrest me üòâ

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:05:28
someone who hacked facebook and threatened them, wouldnt be stubborn enough to share that on discord, where they can have 2 life sentences for hacking and corporate espionage

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:05:19
My point is. Never underestimate lone wolves. SoftBank Robotics will die if they don't open opportunity for outsiders to write software for their robots.


Its your problem.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:04:07
i obviously dont

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:03:59
You can believe me or not.


Now if they arrest me, they have to admit theirs shareholders, that they are cheap idiots and lost billions because they were not given a few tens of thousands of dollars to the man who hack them.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 11:01:53
so.... which software did u use?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 11:01:00
I got caught one day and found a second serious break in Facebook platform.  A month before I hacked them I told them: Now you will pay me for the first problem I discovered 2017, then for the new one. They refused because they thought I was bluffing, I hacked them. They lost billions.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:58:18
its patched so no problem right?


can i see that python code?


i still doubt u.....

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:57:08
Because, 2017 year I accidentally found a problem on their site that allowed automated retrieval of phone numbers to their users with simple Python code.  I was stupid enough to inform them about it on it support. So  they fixed the problem quietly.  They did not pay me anything for that.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:55:59
i highly doubt u hacked facebook


jkjk


*searches up online*


which software u use?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:51:38
I'm the man who HACK Facebook. As you can see no one arrest me yet. They perfectly know who am I but can not do nothing. Do you know why?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:48:55
i mean they hired several people specialized in specific things and made it spending hours


but u say Boston Dynamics has sh*tty software but its not like u can make something better


i dont mean it as an insullt

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:41:57
Do you understand, these their robots not good for anything useful, just because they NOT have the appropriate software.  For example, Boston Dynamic does good hardware for robots, but software is the weak link for them. That's why Google is getting rid of them. It was a good business move from Google site. If SoftBank want to make progress they must think outside the box. For example, I will never work for them    but I'd love to make paid software for their robots, which their specialists can not. And here we fall into a dilemma. I can make wonderful software for their robots, but I can not test it. RENTING online is simple solution.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:35:18
and most companies will fail whether it be a clothing brand or a tech brand if they give stuff out for free


they are a pretty big company rn


google didnt fail

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:32:55
They will, or they will die in this robot endeavor like Google

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:32:51
which is a pretty stubborn thing to do


they wont give out robots for free cuz then theyll be losing money


anyways


they give out their code for FREEEEEE


except for this BEAUTIFUL COMPANY that made webots


nowadays most companies are about profit


no its just that i doubt softbank will give out their robots for free

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:31:50
No, in the near future I will make enough profits from selling software for them.


Ie. whether I want to make a profit out of this endeavor?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:30:26
ah nothin

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:29:30
I don't understand question DarkMatter

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:28:58
u want pepper?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:27:05
Ok I write issue. You are too dubious. SoftBank Robotics will agree and will provide these robots for free.  They have no idea what they can do with them. You will see.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 10:11:10
with an issue, it's simpler to be notified.


ok thank you


that the creation of an online but real testing setup would be a good idea.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:10:19
I will


Ok

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:09:57
ur idea abt NAO and softbank

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:09:27
to summarize what?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:09:03
im assuming its u

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 10:09:02
maybe you in fact üòÉ

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:08:50
Fabien, to whom you talking about?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 10:06:51
We could keep a trace of this.


Could I ask you to summarize this in a github issue? [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues)


It's typically a project which would deserve to be proposed as an european project: to sell it before any trial üòÉ

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:04:54
im doing it cuz im passionate

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:04:52
it ease to bait on NAO and SoftBank

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:04:48
then ur thinking only of profit

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:04:38
because it it time consuming

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:04:22
so why not go for that option?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:04:14
yes, cheaper and better

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:03:58
i mean its cheaper right?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:03:55
Next will see, if SoftBank no interest

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:03:54
then why dont you do that?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:03:43
If they refuse, we will think another option. Including making our own robot, better from NAO

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 10:03:27
im gonna be completely honest here, I dont think softbank would allow that even if its a good idea

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 10:02:56
Think the idea and try to sell it to them. After they return answer tell me what is it.


Can you ask SoftBank if they want to sell several robots on cheap for this purpose üòÉ


If you make complex environment where everyone can test what he want it will be good add

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:58:41
this is a good idea to think about

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:58:21
and rent it out


u could get a NAO

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:57:54
NAO will be other thing


These robots are cheap, and renting will not be profitable, because there will be no interest in rent.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:56:25
u gotta take care of robots because when singularity happens everyone who didnt will die

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:55:47
honestly, I have unfortunately not much time for this üò¶


this is very old, but I once worked on this setup, which is very close of what we are speaking about: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5zRy2Rb5U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH5zRy2Rb5U)

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:54:41
I really want to make joke with SoftBank


Fabien, do you allow some testing on yours real NAO?


No need to be


from time to time

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:52:45
can't be too safe

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:52:16
in my opinion he will endure and there will be a profit, even if repair is required.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:51:36
or accept money to make it run or walk


its like a baby, u dont force it to walk or run when its just born

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:51:12
in my experiment, there are lot of ways to break a robotm but I'm maybe pessimist with this topic, because I come from software engineering

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:50:22
they should take good care

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:50:20
Are you sure, that this is only theory?!

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:50:17
its expensive.....


and sparks!

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:50:01
No, I know how to protect the motors, I don't know why NAO don't have such protection?!

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:49:58
and that creates friction


the center pole

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:49:45
this is the theory haha

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:49:44
well most motors have the copper wire connected to the actual line thing

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:49:18
why motor will overheats when reach its limits - it must be stop to do more load from that it can stands

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:49:17
good question to ask on [https://robotics.stackexchange.com/](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/)

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:48:49
thx tho


ah

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:48:40
I'm not expert in motors, sorry.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:48:19
and cheap......


and DC not AC


for carrying heavy objects


oh ye did i ask already, does anyone know a good motor for robotics?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:47:39
It would be much more realist to do that on wheeled robots

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:47:36
is there not protection mechanism?!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:47:18
a bad command => the motor overheats and is dead

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:46:57
i mean its technically the same thing right? the software and hardware... :/

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:46:54
a fall => the camera is broken

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:46:45
how breakable do you test it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:46:44
I had bad experiments on the robotis op


hardware on such robots is unfortunately also very breakable

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:46:13
im j gna continue using the software cuz its FREEEEEE

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:46:11
what happen with NAO in heavy falls is someone test it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:45:45
and this does not prevent to do heavy falls

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:45:38
break, will be include in equation and will have protect software for that purpose

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:45:25
the API should be very very robust

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:45:21
tru

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:45:12
I also fear that users would break robots in such system

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:44:46
yes

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:44:44
same, mainly cuz im scared ill break it

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:44:39
I mean to have an online access to a real robot.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:44:30
I talk only for online rent, not real

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:44:28
but then again, their software is exactly that right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:44:10
Yes, this seems much more doable online.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:44:09
ye

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:43:59
Why. The user can upload software to robot, and see result in real time for hour or so

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:43:41
like cam


even if its online?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:43:31
due to constraints with delivery


Renting for less than a day seems impossible

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:43:03
ye tru

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:42:56
If NAO withstand

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:42:53
this has to be thought. create a buisness model. A priori, I think it would be too expensive to work.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:42:43
that is a lot of money


40k euros if u run it 24/7/365


they would profit a little right?


well i mean if they charge 5 euros an hour

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:41:40
Ooo, this time it will be more from "nice to see you".  So you think RENT will be not profitable?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:40:43
ah

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:40:27
robotstadium was a contest we organized

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:38:36
Do you remember the Robostadium old forum, and the most watched topic there, "to stand up the NAO from any position".

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:36:32
so hobbyist?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:36:18
Not, I'm not.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:35:47
i want to do it as a job but not old enough YET.... :/

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:35:29
`@Emil Enchev` Are you from industry, academics or hobbyist?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:35:19
but thats just annoying


apart from controlling each motor 1 by 1

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:35:05
I can make NAO to do Backflip if it have power for it

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:34:59
im tryna build a bipedal robot but i have no idea how to  stabilise things


meh

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:34:32
they do with with many tests


This carap stabilization system they have, can be build very easy with self adapting software

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:33:51
although there isnt any real life situation that could help society by doing a backflip


like have u seen atlas doing the frickin back flip

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:33:33
Nothing

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:33:27
they achieved SOME things


meh

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:33:18
Haha

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:33:08
Not, they are amateurs. Years and achieved nothing

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:32:43
u work at boston dynamics?

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:32:21
I can make better software from Boston Dynamic üòâ


SoftBank are very deluded.  They have to lower prices or put them on cheap rent online

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:31:52
robotics is my hobby.....


5


probs like 3 hours


well i wont rent for 3 months.....

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:31:07
So would you pay 3000$ for a rent of 3 months?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:30:25
but i dont think it can withstand 24/7/365

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:30:25
The cost of the service should be evaluated too, there are not only benefits haha

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:30:03
thats 760 euros profit

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:29:40
1 Euro on Hour, 24 on day,  8760 euro for year. Of course, if NAO withstand 1 year üòÉ

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:28:52
(sort of....)


its like paying someone to 3d print something

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:28:45
Having an online testing service seems more doable.


Maybe that the robot manufactors would be interested by such concept.


Sending a robot worldwide is costly, robots are breakable (so a QA service should be created), etc.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:27:30
like add a camera etc.


what about like online physical testing.... :/

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:26:34
This is for sure a good idea. But I fear that the price for a rent of a 8000 euros robot would be prohibitive too.

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:26:32
i meant that i would be happy to pay a small fee for testing


if ur talking abt me i meant the rent services

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:25:51
for NAO i mean


Euro 8000 for now is not what many users can afford

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:25:17
i would pay!

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:25:07
Why you don't organize some RENT services. Pay for time test small tax

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 09:24:54
are the robots available to the public?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:24:24
What do you have in mind?


We have serveral real robots in our office, the Nao, Robotis OP, several small wheeled robots, etc.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:23:30
I talk about real robots, not simulation of real robots.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/27/2019 09:22:33
We do, we have a collection of robots here üòÉ

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 09:21:40
Why you don't buy some real robots for online testing by your Webots users?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:29:12
You're welcome, no problem, it is always good to have feedback, we will improve the calibration of the contact for this benchmark for a future version.

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:28:11
Ok David, obviously I first must read documentation and next to complain from bugs. Thanks

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:26:11
But as described in the doc, it is possible to faithfully calibrate the contact properties: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/contactproperties)


Indeed the friction betwwen the feets and the ground seems badly calibrated in this simulation...

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:25:03
But this is important for me, because I will work on walking-running stabilization programming

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:23:59
In your case it seems you are exploiting some physical instabilites of the physics engine of Webots....

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:23:57
Obviously some developer don't think about side resistance as a factor.  Run first place [https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid\_sprint/](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid_sprint/) and answer me is this simulation behavior normal for Webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/27/2019 07:22:41
Hi, congrats for your ranking !

Yes, many researcher are using Webots for walk simulation. Do you have any problem or specific need for your simulations?

##### bing feng 06/27/2019 07:21:39
im new too


nice

##### Emil Enchev 06/27/2019 07:21:08
walking simulations at all?

Look my first place simulation [https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid\_sprint/](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/humanoid_sprint/) . I'm new in Webots and I think is this good environment for making

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/26/2019 13:10:36
Webots is compatible with C, C++, Matlab, Java, Python and ROS.

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 13:01:56
and sorta have a little bit of python and C


cuz im tryna build a robot using arduino and a raspberry pi


which programming language does webot use?


oh wow

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:58:34
please take a look at the node hierachy, and the object center.

we guarantee it's clean

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:56:35
im hoping this file doesnt have a virus or malware (not an insult) cuz windows defender marked it as dangerous


yeye

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:55:54
then create a node hierarchy

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:55:42
ah


then how will i or this godly software know where to move the joints?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:55:33
you need to split the object into peaces, one node per DOF


no rig

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:54:46
ok i cant find it cuz im not that good at blender (literally started this year) but do i need to rig the model in order for it to move?


hold on ill send screenshots


no i meant the thingy

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:44:50
If you open these files, you will certainly understand what I mean: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter/tree/master/examples/abb](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter/tree/master/examples/abb)


No, the exporter is currently only supporting solids. You need to create a node per degree of freedom (aka DOF, aka Solid), and create  a tree hierarchy in blender. The relative center of the nodes will used as joint pivot center. The rotation axis can be set in the JSON file.

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:41:40
cuz i have no experience in those


to moves the parts do i need to add things like bones and rigid body things.....

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:39:03
If you have good knowledge in Blender, you could start by studying the arm example. If the node hierarchy is well done in Blender, it's simple to export the Blender model to Webots.

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:37:19
oh wow u guys have atlas!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/26/2019 12:37:18
But it's perfectly possible to use the exporter to create a humanoid


In the exporter, an Arm is used as an example.


Webots contains lot of biped robots: here is the list of the released robots: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/robots)

##### bing feng 06/26/2019 12:36:09
but im thinking of using blender to create the base model


well im downloading the webots software rn

do you mean in the exporter?


Hi, yes for sure. We have several biped models.

is it possible to simulate a bipedal robot instead of an arm?


okok thx

Let us know if you have specific questions.


Everything is explained here: [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)


We even have a blender to Webots exporter.

`@JustDN` using the PositionSensor as you do is the correct way to check if motor movement is completed.

##### JustDN 06/25/2019 16:11:53
Is there a way to check if a motor has moved to its intended location before executing the next action in C? I've been using an if statement "if(-1.31<wb\_position\_sensor\_get\_value(arms)&& wb\_position\_sensor\_get\_value(arms)<-1.299)" is there an easier way to than doing this?


Thank you! It works.

Something like this. We use often this pattern.

What you tried seems correct.


Hi,

Hi

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 16:10:01
`@TH0`  , you are completely right, the coordinate system of the nao is not perfect as it is by default rotated, you should therefore combine your rotation with the '1   0  0  -1.5708' rotation, we do not provide any tool to do this, but I am sure you can find some nice libraries that do this.

##### TH0 06/21/2019 15:56:47
i guess the coordinate system from the nao proto itself is rotated and that caused the strange values. but maybe you know a simple work around for that


Hi, is there some helper function to calculate the SFRotation values?

for example: i just like to rotate a Nao (in the soccer simulation) by a supervisor program by alpha degrees keeping the feet on the ground. 

I thought just to set the rotation vector to the y axis (perpendicular to the field) and than simply adjust the angle. but that does not work.



In contrast the values for such a SFRotation are strange:

Looking towards first goal from center circle: SFRotation = 1   0  0  -1.5708

Looking to other side towards opposite goal from center circle (turn by 180 degrees): 0   0.7071    0.7071    -3.1415

`@SamuelKopp`: webots 2> /dev/null ?

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 13:06:17
then it prints out  the correct number


dWebotsConsolePrintf("%s\n", emitterData);


I now have


I think it works okay now

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/21/2019 12:35:26
how do I ignore the warnings that webots outputs on starting from the terminal?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 12:32:30
(or ignore the warnings, or install a virtual sound card on your VM).


`@El_Samu_El`: in that case, you should probably recompile Webots from the sources and disable the sound functions (initialization, etc.).

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 12:31:46
I still crash

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/21/2019 12:30:48
Yeah the sound is turned off. I think it complains because there isn't any sound card.

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 12:30:44
ah yeah the 1st line was char *emitterData; , the copy didn't work properly for some reason.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 12:29:49
printf should be %s, not %f


You need to receive char *, not char.

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 12:29:18
The resulting print is:  0.000000


I now have :

char *emitterData;

int size;

 emitterData = (char*) dWebotsReceive(&size);

 dWebotsConsolePrintf("%f\n", *emitterData);

And try to print the received string instead of trying to convert it to float (for now).

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 12:24:49
I will try.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 12:24:36
Can you try using char * instead of C++ string?

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 12:22:41

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 12:22:34
Are you using Python 2 or 3 ?

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 12:19:57
the second line in the physics plugin "std::string emitterData" can be ignored


so I tried to use sscanf to convert the controllers sent string to float


I couldn't get that to work


I tried your earlier suggestion of receiving doubles instead because python doesn't have float.


std::string *emitterData;

std::string *emitterData;

emitterData = (std::string*) dWebotsReceive(&size);

const char *cstr = emitterData->c\_str();

float target;

 sscanf(cstr, "%f", &target); // convert string to float

dWebotsConsolePrintf("%f\n", target);


ill send physics plugin again


std::string *emitterData;

int size; emitterData = (std::string*) dWebotsReceive(&size);

   const char *cstr = emitterData->c\_str();

   float target;

   sscanf(cstr, "%f", &target); // convert string to float

   //float aNumero=strtof((*emitterData).c\_str(),0); // string to float

   //float val = std::stof(*emitterData); 

   //HERE

   dWebotsConsolePrintf("%f\n", target);


the c++ physics plugin is


b = repr(msg).encode()

        print("b: " + str(b))

        emit1.send(b)


the python controller is:


I still crash


Okay, thanks for your time.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 10:36:16
If you can't achieve this, you can always pass strings and convert them to float using sscanf(s, "%f", &value);

##### nisuunn 06/21/2019 10:35:32
Thank you, I will try that

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/21/2019 10:35:15
I believe Python don't have IEEE float, but only double. Replace const float emitterData = (float) with const double *emitterData = (double *)and replace %d with %g or %f in your printf...

Yes, that solves it

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:51:09
Probably, I would suggest to try

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:50:58
so selfcollision to false would help?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:50:41
In that cas that can indeed be a problem, because the legs might collide with the touchsensors and prevent them from moving

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:50:02
the robots selfCollision field in the node tree is set to true

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:49:32
did you enable the robot.selfCollision ?

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:49:24
a child of torso


the sensor is attached to the torso


the boundingobject touches the robots legs, is that okay?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:44:46
I just tried and it is working fine, you can define the BoundingObject of the touchSensor without defining any Physics node. What is the weird behavior you observe? Did you make sur the bounding object of the sensors is not touching anythin elese than the robot itself (the collision with this bounding object will still be taken into account).


let me try


You obviously need to define the boundingObject of the touchsensor to define the detection area, but you should be able to not add any physics

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:42:29
but the mass of boundingobject gets added to robots mass


when i add physics node robots physics is normal


then my robot's physics behaves weirdly,


when I have touchsesnor of  type bumper without physics defined

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:41:25
Ah ok, for the touchsensors it is indeed different

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:41:15
trying to use touchsensor and set its boundingobject


im sorry i meatn touch sensor


The documentation says that no physics node is needed for bumper type of touchsensor

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 15:40:13
If you want to set both the mass and desity to 0, you simply have to remove the 'Physics' node.

##### nisuunn 06/20/2019 15:39:29
is there any way around this?


which is undesirable


but this boundingobject adds the mass of the boundingobject to my robot


for which I need to define a boundingobject


I would liek to use an IMU


Hello, is it possible to set the boundingobject mass to 0?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/20/2019 06:15:41
`@adhitthana`: Yes, this is possible (we use this when running Webots in the cloud).

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2019 14:35:18
This is a basic C programming question and is not related with Webots.


(note %d instead of %s)


if passing a int *


dWebotsConsolePrintf("%d\n", emitter[0]);


Your printf is wrong anyhow, it should be:


it should be dWebotsConsolePrintf("%s\n", emitter\_data);

##### nisuunn 06/19/2019 14:34:02
but if i was sending int instead of char, then I'd still use int?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/19/2019 14:33:55
dWebotsConsolePrintf("%s\n", emitter[0]); seems wrong


It should be "char *emitter\_data"


int *emitter; seems wrong


You should send plain text from your Python controller and read plain text from the physics plugin.

##### nisuunn 06/19/2019 14:31:56
What is the correct way of sending a message?


This crashes my webots

Unfortunately Webots needs a GUI, we don't have better solutions for now.

I already took a look into the cli options but none of them has the wanted effect (that is without having the Webots icon popping up on the application bar), sadly.

Did you thought to use a InerialUnit instead of a Compass? It can return the roll/pitch/yaw, yaw is basically what you need.


It's probably due to your algorithm.

The output values are not proper it is varying from 270 to 360 only. Any solution so that I can get proper values in the output, like on 56 degree the output will be 56 or on 219 degree output will be 219?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/19/2019 06:29:03
`@Akash` the Compass returned value is the direction of virtual north so you cannot perform the conversion directly using the lookup table becaue the returned value for a 45 degrees rotations is [0.7075, 0, 0.7075]. Instead you should compute the angle in your controller using the `get_bearing_in_degress()` function described in the Reference Manual:  [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass#wb\_compass\_get\_values](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass#wb_compass_get_values)

##### Akash 06/19/2019 00:05:05
Can get a proper lookup table chart values for 'Compass'. The lookup table I have made it is having three vector values -1, 0 and 1, and three response values 0, 90 and 180. When I rotate the bot on 0, 90 or 180 degree the function compass.getValues() giving proper response/output values of 0, 90 and 180 respectively, but while I rotate it to any other degree output values are not as expected like on 45 degree the function is giving a output value of 23. Is there any proper lookup table chart by which  on 45 degree a output value of 45 can be achieved?

Could you "print(n)" just before line 26? This should be a string, but it is certainly not.


A Python String is expected, and something else is given


`@El_Samu_El` The error is more related with the argument passed to getFromDef


`@Karl` ok, it will be released with the new release, coming soon.

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/18/2019 12:07:23
self.getFromDef("motorname")


I'm not really understanding this error code. Isn't the first argument here "self" and thus a Supervisor. My class is inheriting SV. Why the type error?

Thanks a lot! Perhaps it would be good to add that to the remote control docs


That was it


Ahh right!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 11:39:23
This allows to switch to the remote control library after some event, typically a GUI button


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb\_robot\_get\_mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot#wb_robot_get_mode)


In addition to set correctly the Robot.remoteControl field (as you mention), the remote control library is used when the wb\_robot\_set\_mode(WB\_MODE\_REMOTE\_CONTROL) is explicitly called in he controller:

##### Karl 06/18/2019 11:18:41
Or is 'running the controller', as described in the remote control docs, different from 'running the simulation'?


I'm developing a remote control and wbr\_init seems to be correctly called from entry\_points . There I link the interface functions to my own (like `ri->mandatory.wbr_start = Wrapper::start;`). However, these functions never seem to be called... also, when running it in WeBots, the simulation still seems to be used. Do I have to tell WeBots to use the real-life remote control somehow? Other than setting it in the remote\_control field of course

Is there an example of this somewhere? On how to use two controllers i mean

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2019 11:02:18
I would recommend to split your robot and your supervisor controllers. To do so you can of course have a supervisor without any physics/shape/etc.


In that case the problem is not removing it, but once removed you won't be able to re-add it because you don't have any supervisor anymore...

##### DimitrisK 06/18/2019 11:00:40
Yes exactly

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2019 10:58:48
You mean the Thmio2 robot itself is the supervisor ?

##### DimitrisK 06/18/2019 10:57:54
I though of that as a possible solution. Can you give me a hint on how tp do that? My robot is the Supervisor so i don't know if removing it could cause problems...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/18/2019 10:49:40
Hi `@DimitrisK`, that is indeed possible that very small physic errors accumulate over the iterations and can cause problems after a high number of iterations.

To work around the issue, you can revert the simulation from your supervisor controller or if you don't want your supervisor controller to restart, you can, after a defined number of iterations (e.g. 50) remove and re-import the Thymio2 robot in the simulation, this way you will have a 'brand new robot' without any accumulated errors.

##### DimitrisK 06/18/2019 10:15:59
I am trying to apply reinforcement learning in the "obstacle avoidance" environment (as seen in robotbenchmark). After a number of iterations (about 120 episodes,with 800 robot steps each) the Thymio2 is literaly falling apart. I can see that gradually the wheels of the robot are starting to stick out of the body more and more,until it eventually falls apart and the physics stop making sense. I am reseting the physics in each  step but doesn't seem to change anything. What could be the problem? Could it be that the robot is "breaking" due to the colision happening during the training? And if so,how can i stop that from happening?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/18/2019 06:38:12
It's in C++, but this released example does similar things: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-howto#vision-wbt)


[https://cyberbotics.com/forum?message=8666](https://cyberbotics.com/forum?message=8666) Here is a small snippet to convert the camera image to a numpy array (the input of Python OpenCV)

Hi, not in the examples provided in Webots. It is up to you to implement it, like many Webots users did.

##### JustDN 06/17/2019 14:26:05
Are there any simulations that uses reinforcement learning?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 13:29:38
Here for example a user reported on our old forum that he successfully managed to let Webots work in WSL (he had problem with ROS but this is another topic): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/forum/forum?message=8265](https://www.cyberbotics.com/forum/forum?message=8265)

##### TH0 06/17/2019 13:17:49
i know what you mean and it's already working in native linux but some of our team members do not use linux as the native OS. So the idea was to "simply" run webots under WSL for development independent from the native OS.

you say: "other users have been able to let it work". do you know who or where to find the tricks for the setup? üòÉ

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 11:52:32
`@Deleted User` Webots can probably work in WSL too (if I remember correctly other users have been able to let it work) but it might be tricky to setup. Won't it be simpler to run it directly under Linux in that case ?

##### TH0 06/17/2019 09:28:36
`@David Mansolino`  Our Robot Controller uses Unix Domain Sockets to emulate the Lola-Interface from a Softbank Nao V6, so it does not work on Windows.

I ask the question about WSL because we also tested Gazebo and it works without problems in WSL and we wonder that webots doesnt and hope it's maybe only a small fix needed.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 07:08:01
You're welcome.

##### MohamedSabry 06/17/2019 07:07:34
`@David Mansolino` thank you so so much, it is working now

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 07:03:35
`@MohamedSabry` have you tried using the safe mode?

 [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)

##### MohamedSabry 06/17/2019 07:02:33
`@David Mansolino` Yes I realized that, but when I installed the latest version, it always crashes even though I updated my graphics drives and made sure to use my "Nvidia Geforce 840M" as the graphics card responsible for the running of the application, so what should I do?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/17/2019 06:29:56
`@TH0` wouldn't it be simpler to use the Windows version of Webots directly if you are on Windows?


`@sai` No this is unfortunately not possible. Howver, you can encapsulate all your objects in a PROTO file (in which you can use our template engine) to do this: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/proto)

Alternatively you can use a Supervisor to change the position of the objects at first step (or any other step): [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/supervisor)


`@MohamedSabry` Which version of Webots are you using? As Webots is now open-source you should not have any problem with licenses if you use the latest one.

##### TH0 06/16/2019 11:28:42
Hi, i have a problem running webots in the windows subsystem for linux:

After starting webots, the gui is shown for part of a second. webots crashed after that with the error:

You are welcome.

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 14:32:39
yep, thanks for the help and suggestions.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 14:32:22
So, you should probably try to complexify your simple example until you get this supposedly wrong behavior and you will likely find the culprit...

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 14:31:35
even when upside down


In the simpler case I tried it in, the spring behaved as expected I think


I'm unable to do it, but it's no issue in my case so it's okay.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 14:03:13
Yes.

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 14:01:27
do you mean with a single slider joint, rather than hinge?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 14:01:02
I see, but it would be interesting to see if you can reproduce the same problem with a single hinge joint which has the same spring property.

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:59:12
but i would expect the springs to support the feet when upside down, as they were able to support the entire robot's mass when the correct way up


and allow the feet to drop down


however when upside down, as can be see from the video, the springs compress


In the video: when the robot is the correct way up, its upper legs are supported by the springs that connect the feet and upper leg

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:56:57
Thank you. However, it is not very clear to me what the problem is. Could you create a minimalist simulation (just one joint) showing the problem?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:49:25
Here is

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:42:13
Can you share a movie showing the problem you have?


Ok, that means it is probably not related with gravity...

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:41:02
even when upside down


at +9.81  springs behave as expected i think


gravity 0: still the same

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:37:24
And setting the gravity to 0?


What about reversing the gravity e.g, +9.81 instead of -9.81?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:35:53
or down to 0.5 as well


lowering the gravity to around 3 still pulls the springs down when upside down


Ill try it out

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:33:27
Did you try to play with the WorldInfo.gravity value to see how it affects the behavior?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:33:23
Perhaps, but if the robot is not upside down, then the springs manage to support the mass of the robot, hence I would expect the springs to not be pulled down by only gravity when upside down

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 06/14/2019 13:32:45
Hi, could that be because of gravity?

##### nisuunn 06/14/2019 13:31:46
with a spring constant


The spring is a slider joint


Hi, my robot has springs around its feet or knees. They work as expected, except for when the robot is upside down. When the robot is upside down, for some reason the springs move in the opposite direction that you'd expect, why is that?

Thanks for your help once again!


Okay, yeah I am new to networking and related stuff in general.  But gave it anyway a try. It's not that easy I think. (For someone with experience it probably is)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:52:28
I'm not sure exactly about how to implement the TCP client-server, sorry.


you could forge a world with a different name for each instance.

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:51:10
would you use the selector module for TCP in python?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:50:57
then probably the template thing is the best


Ok

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:50:32
But I need to start these processes sometimes with different configurations, thus the controller argument.


So I was trying to workaround this by simply starting several processes and restarting them as often as it is written in a file

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:49:27
It's a good starting point for sure

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:49:04
I made that TCP server already, but there were some issues with it.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:43:12
Does this make sense for your expectations?


For example, the script launching Webots could also have a TCP server, the Webots controllers could be TCP clients, and get the info from there. It has the advantage to be persistent (results could be sent the same way later). And it's a piece of cake to do that in Python üòÉ


In this case, there are certainly better solutions.


With several instances, the two options above are still valid (Webots will read the state when it is launched), but in this case, you probably have to be sure that Webots read the right value by implementing a callback mechanism.

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:37:48
yeah the last option you mention, was what I was also thinking


That's true, but if I want to startup multiple webots processes with different controllers, but the same world file?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:36:36
Or, to create a template.wbt, and forge it before launching Webots on it (and change controllerArgs for example)


So you can for example create a file before launching Webots, and read it in the controllers.


We assume you master your environment when launching Webots.


No, you can't pass arguments like this.

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:34:36
or does it also work in some way like "webots --mode=fast "example.wbt" "controllerArg"

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:34:21
üòÉ I was sure of this

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:33:58
Ah but as I understand this it just get's arguments from the .wbt file


okay, I'll have a look. Thanks again Fabien !

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:30:01
you can retrieve them with sys.argv in the controller


yes

##### El\_Samu\_El 06/13/2019 14:29:38
Ah, is that also possible with python?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 14:29:21
Yes sure, see Robot.controllerArgs field

very good. thank you so much. could you show me how to  choose the sensor to add robot please? i can't find any sensor.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 11:54:28
But every existing lidar model (like Sick) are in fact a Lidar node.


If you would like to use an existing Lidar model, just add a node to your robot, from the GUI, you can select a Sick, etc.


Yes, this demo is very basic. It shows how to use the Lidar node.


You could simply copy the Lidar node, and paste it in another robot.

##### nick\_robot\_maker 06/13/2019 11:31:20
you means this lidar sensor is just default sensor?


um.. then if i want to make new world and want to use this lidar model, what can i do?

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 11:25:43
Ok, it's simply a generic lidar, no model

##### nick\_robot\_maker 06/13/2019 11:24:51

it is named lidar.wbt


the world


yes

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/13/2019 11:22:49
Do you speak about lidar.wbt?


In your case, it's probably "lidar", the default value of the Lidar.name field.


You can know the device names by opening the robot window (double click on the robot).


Hi,

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/12/2019 06:43:00
`@JustDN`, yes we have an example of controller using OpenCV, please see 'projects/samples/robotbenchmark/visual\_tracking'.

But more generally speaking, you can link your controller with any third party library installed on your computer, here is an explanation for C/C++: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/using-webots-makefiles#adding-an-external-library-ccp)


@THO, this is not currently possible, however, we have a prototype of such feature, see this video at 1:09:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=1&v=O7U3sX\_ubGc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O7U3sX_ubGc)

If you want we can either send you a quote for finalizing and integrating this prototype into Webots for you or you can do it by yourself directly (we can guide you if you open a pull request on our Github repository).

is it a typo?


`@El_Samu_El` getFromDev does not exits.


<@302517149359144962> Ok it seems to work better on Windows then ^^ The warning is "regular": it appears when Webots detects low-end GPU (including VM).

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 13:05:39
Can you send a screen shot of the 2 robot with the different COM ?


It should not cause any problem

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 13:05:05
even if this doesn't have an effect on the original robot's COM?


Could this have an influence?


The main body of the robot, has the coord axes at one of the 4 corners of the body, rather than the center of the body.


I don't really have any simple reproduction procedure


I haven't saved after running sim.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 12:59:49
It should not, the COM should be at the same position (respectively to the robot) than the one of the other robot. Did you save the simulation after it has run? Do you have a simple procedure to reproduce the issue?

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 12:19:29
Is there any specific reason as to why the centre of mass changes when a copy of a robot is created? (the COM changes such that rather than the COM being in the ~centre of the robot, the COM shifts to the front of the robot, such that it is highly unstable compared to the original robot. )

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 12:07:35
You're welcome

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 12:07:19
okay, thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 11:04:30
The COM depends on the origin of the robot (i.e. it's translation) and the gonfiguration of its joints.

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 11:02:47
how does that affect relative COM, isn't relative COM indpendent of translation and orientation/rotation of the robot?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 11:01:07
Yes, that's also a possibility. you can set the correct value for the 'translation and rotation' fields directly when you import the robot.

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 10:34:17
Could I also just get the original robot's centre of mass field with supervisor and apply that centre of mass to the new spawned robot?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/11/2019 10:32:10
`@BlackPearl`, you're welcome


HI `@nisuunn`, you can use the Supervisor APi to get the location and orientation of the other robot and assign it to the new one:

##### nisuunn 06/11/2019 10:30:32
I am using a supervisor to spawn in a copy of a robot. The copy's relative centre of mass differs form the original robot's relative COM, why does that happen and how to fix that?

In which kind of environment would you like to run Webots? The simplest option is to use the '--batch' option when starting Webots, this will prevent Webots from opening any blocking pop-up window, and the '--minimize' option to launch Webots in minimized mode. However you still need to have a valid OpenGl context, if this is problematic there are some way to go around this, let us know.

##### Mi 06/06/2019 19:17:58
Is there any way to run Web Webs in headless mode?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/06/2019 15:45:59
I hope this answers your question.


Here is the simplest example of initialization: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr\_cube/ipr\_cube.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr_cube/ipr_cube.cpp)


The IPR class inherits of the Robot class.


Position sensors are enabled in this library, in the IPR constructor: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.cpp#L81](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.cpp#L81)


This function is declared in this small library helping to control the IPR: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.hpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.hpp)


Do you speak about this controller? [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr1\_collaboration/ipr1\_collaboration.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/neuronics/ipr/controllers/ipr1_collaboration/ipr1_collaboration.cpp)

##### JustDN 06/06/2019 15:21:57
I'm also trying to follow the code using "mTimeStep = getBasicTimeStep();" and  "while (!positionReached(shoulderr, 1))

   step(basicTimeStep());" and I was told that I they weren't declared in the scope, I looked at the simulation code and didn't find any of the declarations, what is the right way to do the declarations in C++?


I was looking at the IPR code and I am confused on now to declare the !positionReached function. Also, would I also have to initialize my position sensors for it to work?

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 06/06/2019 06:09:26
`@Vinicius Aguiar` your issue is very similar to the one of `@JustDN`: after setting the first position you have to wait until the position is reached before requesting the second position.

To check if the position is reached you can the PositionSensor device. The  `robots/neuronics/ipr/worlds/ipr_collaboration.wbt` I mentioned in the previous comment shows a simple way to execute consecutive actions with robotic manipulators.


`@JustDN` int the main simulation loop `while(wb_robot_ste()){}` you have to check using a PositionSensor that the first action terminated before starting the next one. You can see an example in the `robots/neuronics/ipr/worlds/ipr_collaboration.wbt` simulation. The `positionReached()` function is defined in the `robots/neuronics/ipr/libraries/ipr/IPR.cpp` source file

##### Vinicius Aguiar 06/05/2019 16:26:56
```
####This is my code in python####

from controller import Robot, Motor
import numpy as np

   target = joint1.getTargetPosition()

   while signal != target:

       target = joint1.getTargetPosition()
       signal = round(signal,2)
       target = round(target,2)

       if signal > target:
          for i in np.arange(target,signal,0.01):
             joint1.setPosition(i)
             print("position",i)

       elif signal < target:
           for i in np.arange(target,signal,-0.01):
               joint1.setPosition(i)
               print("position",i)

while robot.step(TIME_STEP) != -1:
   # first position
   position(1.57)
   # second position
   position(-1.57)
```


Hello, could you guys help me?



I'm programming a robotic manipulator and wanted to move the base of it by 90 ¬∞ positive and then by 90 ¬∞ negative when I perform the print of each step of the position occurs as expected, but in the simulation it only performed the negative part, ignoring the first position .

##### JustDN 06/05/2019 16:20:51
HI, I'm having trouble having consecutive actions to occur. I wanted my robot to raise its arm and then go back down. When programming the motors to do the actions, the arm down action overrided the arm up action so only the arm down action occured. I tried adding a sleep delay in between each action but that delay took precedent over the actions, so there is a delay at the start of the program and then the actions occurred.


Thank you for the help! `@Fabien Rohrer`

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/05/2019 14:49:15
There is a C++ note about this, in our documentation: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/motor#motor-functions)


This deserves to include: "#include <limits>" too


[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric\_limits/infinity](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits/infinity)


std::numeric\_limits<double>::infinity


in C++, you should write infinity this way:


No, it means that the INFINITY macro is not declared here. (INFINITY is a macro defined in the C header "math.h")


Hi

##### JustDN 06/05/2019 14:45:48
I'm trying to set a motor position for my OP2 code to infinity with "shoulderl->setPosition(INFINITY);" but when running the code, I came across the error " 'INFINITY' was not declared in this scope" does that mean that the OP2 is unable to do that?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/05/2019 05:35:43
HI `@Mi` , this is currently not possible,  Webots is responsible to launch the Webots script for now.

However, we did implement a new mechanism allowing you to launch yourself the controller in our development version, here is the documentation: 

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?version=develop](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/running-extern-robot-controllers?version=develop)

We will release a new version of Webots including this functionnality in ~1month.

In the meantime, if you need this feature you can recompile Webots yourself from the 'develop' branch, here are the instructions:

[https://github.com/omichel/webots/wiki#installation-of-the-webots-development-environment](https://github.com/omichel/webots/wiki#installation-of-the-webots-development-environment)

Hello

Is it possible to control a robot through an external python script?

For example my script runs on my terminal and Webots responds to commands.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 06/04/2019 15:11:39
Yes of course it is possible to control the motor individually, for this you should not use the motion or gait manager.

The code you provide seems correct, but make sur to call the wb\_robot\_step function in your main loop.

Here is a simple example of position feedback and position control with this robot: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/robotis/darwin-op/controllers/symmetry/Symmetry.cpp](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/robotis/darwin-op/controllers/symmetry/Symmetry.cpp)

##### JustDN 06/04/2019 15:04:44
For the OP2, is there a way to call each individual motor? I've tried using WbDeviceTag shoulderR = wb\_robot\_get\_device("ShoulderR"); and then setting the position using wb\_motor\_set\_position(shoulderR, 10.0); but it doesn't move at all. Am I incorrectly calling the motor? If so, what is the correct way?

Hi Fabien Rohrer , thank you very much for the information. I will check the it.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/04/2019 11:47:55
If performance is an issue, I would rather recommend to implement a MovieTexture node, but this is a complex task.


Indeed, the Display is not optimized to stream images.


However, I think this approach will be very slow.


The movie should be send image by image using this API.


[https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb\_display\_image\_load](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/display#wb_display_image_load)


The Display API allows to load an image as a texture in the world.


Yes, this is possible

So that you can merge the two JSON files afterwards.


With the same time stamp as the web animation JSON.


Alternatively, you may save the GPS and IMU telemetry information from your controller program into a different JSON file.


But you can implement it from the source code of Webots if needed.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 06/01/2019 11:35:56
This problem is more complex that it could appear in a first glance. Computing the robot odometry could give based on motor position sensor could give good results on wheeled robots (cf. E-puck go to example in the curriculum). Cheating with a perfect GPS and Compass is another solution (cf. Moose sample). Ultimately when obstacles are present, implementing a SLAM algo may be required. You should think about using a library like gmapping.

Please feel free to contribute such a suggestion on github:  [https://github.com/omichel/webots/edit/master/docs/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot.md](https://github.com/omichel/webots/edit/master/docs/guide/tutorial-6-4-wheels-robot.md)

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:34:25
A recommendation then, is to add a section at the end that shows how the entire code should look like.  That will make sure there is no confusion.  Just a suggestion.


Ah, yes.  That is the confusion about not including the statements provided by the wizard.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:32:01
(added by the Python controller wizard)


What is missing in the Python template? The "robot = Robot()" is there.

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:31:04
Don't forget to add

¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:29:44
Indeed, it is not necessary, but in theory could be useful to benefit from 100% of the Motor API.

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:29:43
Thanks.

I'm a bit concerned about omitting the steps that auto filled by the controller wizard.  In my opinion, it is better for the student if all code lines are included.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:28:10
Not sure whether it is strictly necessary if "from controller import Robot" was done before. Let me check...

##### Mr. Scruff 05/31/2019 06:26:40
HI `@Olivier Michel` .   How about ¬´from controller import Motor¬ª ?  Should it also be removed?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/31/2019 06:25:05
Regarding the "from controller import Robot", I believe there is no need to repeat it at this point as it should already be part of your Python controller (e.g., before adding the motor API).


<@272974104523702273>: This is already fixed here: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/pull/496](https://github.com/omichel/webots/pull/496)


Hi,

##### Luiz Felipe 05/31/2019 03:16:18
Yes `@Fabien Rohrer` everything was working fine until yesterday but the safe mode did it! Thanks üòÉ

##### Mr. Scruff 05/30/2019 22:48:45
Glad to be able to help üòÉ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/30/2019 20:41:48
Thank you, we will fix the tutorial soon.

##### Mr. Scruff 05/30/2019 20:34:45
Oh, and 

wheels = []


`@Fabien Rohrer` , if I define the robot variable:  ¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª 

then I get the error: "name 'Robot' is not defined"



But, if I define the robot variable ¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª 

and change 

 ¬´from controller import Motor¬ª 

to

 ¬´from controller import Robot¬ª 

Then everything works fine.



If the above is correct, then the tutorial example code needs to change in 2 places, to:

 ¬´from controller import Robot¬ª

and

¬´ robot = Robot()¬ª

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/30/2019 20:20:43
You could also try the safe mode: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/starting-webots#safe-mode)


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/system-requirements](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/system-requirements)


`@Luiz Felipe` are you sure you are above the minimal requirements to run Webots and that your GPU drivers are up to date?


<@272974104523702273> did you defined the ¬´¬†robot¬†¬ª variable above?

##### Mr. Scruff 05/30/2019 20:16:36
Hi `@Fabien Rohrer` .  If I simply replace ¬´ Motor wheels = [] ¬ª by ¬´ wheels = [] ¬ª

then the following Python error appears:  "NameError: name 'robot' is not defined"

##### Luiz Felipe 05/30/2019 09:00:28
I am having troubles with the version 2019a running in windows... I already uninstalled and reinstalled trying to solve the issue... When I start the simulator, right after the following print screen it suddenly closes... So, i can not open the simulator anymore... Any idea on what can be the problem? Cheers.

Hello everyone, first of all thanks for the hard work.. The simulator is amazing...

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/30/2019 08:12:16
I would simply replace ¬´¬†Motor wheels = []¬†¬ª by ¬´¬†wheels = []¬†¬ª


There is indeed an issue.

##### Mr. Scruff 05/29/2019 21:10:29
Is there an issue with this portion of the tutorial documentation (see attached)?  I'm getting a Python error, complaining that "Motor wheels = []"  has a syntax error.

Instead, this simple code worked:



from controller import Robot

robot = Robot()

speed = -1.5  # [rad/s]

wheelsNames = ['wheel1', 'wheel2']

wheels = []

for i, name in enumerate(wheelsNames):

    wheels.append(robot.getMotor(name))

    wheels[i].setPosition(float('inf'))

    wheels[i].setVelocity(speed)



timestep = int(robot.getBasicTimeStep())

while robot.step(timestep) != -1:

    pass

The 'robotNode.getField('translation')' function will return a Field object, you therefore have to keep it and use it:

  translationField.setSFVec3f(INITIAL\_TRANS)

I think it is already redirected to my computer

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 10:39:53
With export DISPLAY / xhost+


In that case, forget about the virtual frame buffer, you simply need to redirect the DISPLAY to your computer.

On the VM instance.

##### Deleted User 05/29/2019 10:37:58
Thanks for the response! Do I need to do this on the VM-Instance or my own computer? Since, others are using the same server to run webots remotely and they do not run into this issue.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/29/2019 10:35:22
Or xf86-video-dummy (Xdummy).


You need to have a GPU enabled compute node or setup a virtual frame buffer (xvfb).

That sounds great. thanks

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/29/2019 06:40:03
The Webots language is very close to VRML (subset + extension) and provides VRML import/export tools. Using blender at some point and its exporter plugin is often required [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter) for example to create low poly meshes. Setting the physics parameters may also require supplementary passes.  Cyberbotics has a lot of expertise in this field.

##### sai 05/29/2019 06:22:44
I have another question. How flexible is the process of importing vrml designs into webots. I haven't tried it before but is it possible to import complex object like a factory machine or something designed in CAD, exported as a vrml format and importing it into webots?


I see, I will have to discuss with my advisor. We will let you know if needed, thanks!!

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/29/2019 06:03:59
If this is not sufficient, we could create new assets and a demo example, if you have some budget for this.

The controller (lidar.c) of this example shows how to use the API in a working situation.


[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#lidar-wbt](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/samples-devices#lidar-wbt)


You could refer to the lidar example:


The documentation above describes all the lidar functions.

##### Ya 05/27/2019 14:51:57
there is a source code to use the lidar ?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/27/2019 14:51:51
[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/lidar)


Now, the Lidar should be accessible in the controller, using the Lidar API:


save the simulation.

I strongly recommend to do our tutorial (at least the first 7) to get familiar with Webots: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials)


You should not do this from the controller, but manually in the Webots scene-tree.

ok, cool, i will try that!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 10:03:45
You can export your robot in vrml from Webots and then import it in Webots, you might loose some information in the precess but at least the meshes (which is what is interesting to edit in blender) should be fine.


Abotu editing the PROTO, it is sometimes difficult indeed to edit directly in text file, for this you can right click on the PROTO node in Webots and press on 'Convert to Base Node(s)' this will 'unprototize' the robot for you.

##### TH0 05/24/2019 10:02:24
ok, and how about importing already existing geometry (like the nao.proto) in blender ?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 10:01:46
Very cool, looking forward to see it !


To edit the mesh we usually use Blender, we have created a plugin to be able to export directly from Blender to Webots (but you can also export in VRML from blender and import it in Webots): [https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter](https://github.com/omichel/blender-webots-exporter)

##### TH0 05/24/2019 10:00:22

Hi, very nice simulation !!

##### TH0 05/24/2019 09:58:09
but i wonder if there is maybe a visual tool to edit the proto files instead of using a text editor? Because my current workflow is extremly ineffective and i am not able to edit the geometry of objects by myself except editing the raw coordinates in the proto files -\_-



Can you recommend a tool for editing proto files and create or change webots objects efficiently?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 08:13:12
Indeed they are hard to see, you should probably change the color of the dot and make sure the  size of the grid is similar to the size of the floor in Webots, then in Webots you can enable the optional rendering 'View->Optional Rendering->Show Lidar Point Cloud' and check if the shapes of the points are similar in Webots and RViz

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/24/2019 08:07:56
Maybe you could also try to visualize the lascer\_scan in rviz just to check if they make sense


I am sorrry but I can't help you further, if the laser scan is correctly published from the Webots side gamping should produce the map, this is more a ROS problem than a Webots problem.

Maybe someone more familiar to ROS could help you.

Then this is probably the problem:

 step0: original robot spawn robot 1

step1: robot1 spawn robot2

step2: robot2 spawn robot3

...

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:40:53
the same supervisor


yes

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:40:37
Does the robot that you spawn have the same controller as the one spawning the robot ?

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:40:34
in one function which is called once


no

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:38:16
Do you call the ` importMFNode(index, path)` function at each step ?

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:36:59
Is there any way around this issue?


however, instead of spawning only one robot, it keeps spawning in the same robot forever, so that more and more of these robots are created in the same exact space, I think the code does not get past this spawning point.


(i'm using importMFNode(index, path))


and into that children field I spawn my desired robot


I'm using supervisor.getRoot().getField('children')


I see, thanks again!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:18:51
You're welcome


you can do something like:

supervisor.getRoot().getField('children').importMFNodeFromString('Robot { translation 1 0 2 }')


You may also be interested by the 'importMFNodeFromString' function

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:17:53
ah okay, perfect, many thanks!

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 13:17:42
Then you can import anything in this field


First, it is better to import you robot at the root level, you can get the root field with something like this:

supervisor.getRoot().getField('children')


Yes of course, let me explain

##### nisuunn 05/23/2019 13:15:44
is there any way for me to spawn in a robot using the inmportMFNode(), or in any other way?


I would like to import a robot (robot node) using a supervisor. I'm trying to use childField.importMFNode(index, robotPath), where childField is the children field of a transform node, however Webots does not let me do this as you cannot import robot nodes into children fields of transform fields

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/23/2019 06:14:03
`@moon`, in which tutorial did you encoutner this problem?


`@Thelm76` since in remote-control you will communicate with the robot only during the step function, the only way to do this is to check the encoder position at each step. If you want something really precise, the only way is to implement position cotnrol directly in the robot library: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/transfer/library/motor\_led/advance\_one\_timer/e\_motors.c](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/transfer/library/motor_led/advance_one_timer/e_motors.c)

I can't use simple while (!condition) because I need to execute other pieces of code at the same time


Hi, I'm still with my position control problem for the e-puck, so I'm editing the library to implement a position control directly into the e-puck firmware, but now I'm stuck because I need an equivalent a events listeners in C... do someone know how can I do this?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/22/2019 07:08:16
I would rather keep it on the controller side, but if you want to make it a bit modular you can wrap this in a library that you can call from each of your controller (so that you don't cuplicate the code in each controller).

##### Mark - AgJunction 05/21/2019 21:43:31
I'm need to output my robot's GPS as CAN traffic.  I've been able to do so from inside the controller, but can someone tell me if using a Controller Plug-In is the correct way to do this?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/21/2019 13:38:44
This is not enabled by default on the e-puck


Webots can also simulate depth of field blur. In this case, the focal distance can be set: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/focus)


Does this answer your question?


But Webots allows to define the horizontal field of view only.


Focal length, principal point and field of view are related with this equation: [https://www.edmundoptics.fr/resources/application-notes/imaging/understanding-focal-length-and-field-of-view/](https://www.edmundoptics.fr/resources/application-notes/imaging/understanding-focal-length-and-field-of-view/)


The focal length and the principal point are different concepts.


The field of view is by default 0.84 radians and this is an open field (it can be modified).


[https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L20](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puck.proto#L20)


This is defined in the E-puck.proto file, let me check...

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/20/2019 14:57:49
For information position control for the e-puck in remote-control is not supported with the remote-control library distributed with Webots: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote\_controls/e-puck\_bluetooth/entry\_points.cpp#L31](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/revision/projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/plugins/remote_controls/e-puck_bluetooth/entry_points.cpp#L31)

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/20/2019 14:56:42
=> wbr\_motor\_set\_position is not defined in this library.


It means that your controller is linked with a remote control library (cf. Robot.remoteControl field) where wbr\_motor\_set\_position should be set.


Hi

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 05/20/2019 06:27:38
Hi `@Jeremy` , you cannot stop it directly, but you can notify the robot controller to stop by the supervisor controller and handle the stop message in the robot controller. For example you can use the Emitter/Receiver ([https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/emitter)) devices to send the stop message from the supervisor to the robot.


Hi `@Amey` , ostacle avoidance is a research topic in robotics and there are many different ways to achieve it. You can find many examples in the provided simulations, I would suggest you to run the Webots Guided Tour and look at the different controller programs. 

We often use the Breitenberg algorithm ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg\_vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle)), for example in

- robots/gctronic/worlds/e-puck.wbt

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/17/2019 13:20:53
robot.step(3000) is probably useless. It should work fine with a robot.step(100) value or so.

##### Thelm76 05/17/2019 13:15:09
I also tried to put a robot.set(3000) to give time to establish the connection


yes, actually, at first I tried to do a position control in python. then I had this messages so I tried to do a velocity control

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/17/2019 12:30:38
Strange... Did you try to make the same kind of motor control as in the C sample? E.g., control in speed rather than in position?

Hi! I have a problem when connecting e-puck by bluetooth to webots as it says "wbr\_motor\_set\_position was called but not set". In the code the only time I call this method is in an init function to set the motors in velocity control mode :

wheels[i].setPosition(float('+inf'))

wheels[i].setVelocity(0)



but the program works just fine in the simulation

We provide examples of remote-control libraries built with gcc and Makefile, but you are free to use other tools.


You can compile it with any C compiler, using CMake or any other build tool.


A remote control library is a simple shared library (DLL on Windows, .so on Linux, .dylib on mac OS)


You just need to compile your own remote-control library.


You don't need to recompile Webots to create a custom remote control.

`@el` in order to get two consecutive frames you have to call `wb_robot_step` function in between. So you have to store the previous camera image and use it in the next `while (wb_robot_step() != -1)` run.


`@Amey`  you should first add the GPS device in the 'turretSlot' of the e-puck because by default the e-puck model doesn't have it. The gps works exactly as all the other sensors. You can for example look at projects/robots/softbank/nao/worlds/nao\_demo.wbt for an example for the Nao robot that uses a GPS  or at projects/languages/python/worlds/example.wbt for a more simple and generic example of how to use sensors in Python

Here is the GPS documentation: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps?tab=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/gps?tab=python)

I correct it


this function can only be used in a 'Supervisor' controller.


why this error shows

I strongly recommend to follow our tutorial (available in Python version) you will then better understand how the control of the robot works: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials?tab=python](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials?tab=python)


No there is unfortunately no tutorial about openaigym and Webots. Yes the Python API is the API used to control your robot in Webots.

##### kim 05/10/2019 07:02:01
and Webots Python api is in Webots program, is it right?


is there a tutorial about the using openaigym and webots?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/10/2019 06:57:55
Not out of the box, but as Webots provide a Python interface you can integrate it yourself to openaigym

##### kim 05/10/2019 06:57:13
Webots supports the openaigym?

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/10/2019 06:56:47

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/08/2019 08:44:57
`@CH_KIM` the duration is in millisecond which means the biggest frequency you can have is 1khz (which is already quite high for a control loop).


`@‡º∫Yatori‡ºª` yes you can add new node (e.g. DistanceSensor nodes) in the 'turretSlot' field of the E-puck node.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 05/05/2019 12:45:43
I also think that OpenCV is only used in some examples in Webots. So you could also simply remove the related files from Webots.


`@el` Indeed, installing opencv is a good idea. If the OpenCV released in Webots is problematic, you could take a look at your LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable, and make sure your OpenCV appears first.


`@Akash` Did you look at the Compass.lookupTable field? [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/compass)

because the cross compilation seems to be too incomplete for what I want to do


So for now I have to leave webots connected to e-pucks. Also I've found some examples on forums, of people trying to use LibIrcom, which permit to send data by the IR sensors, but I can't find any examples of working codes. So I think I will give up the cross-compilation idea for now and stay with the remote control thing

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/03/2019 12:17:15
Hi, this is not supported out of the box, if you are using remote-control you might use emitter-receiver. But with remote-control you will need to implement this by yourself.

##### David Mansolino [cyberbotics] 05/03/2019 12:13:59
That's indeed higly possible, has the physics dll is loaded by Webots directly, if there is a crash in the physics plugin, Webots will crash as well.

##### AntiSquid 05/03/2019 11:43:52
`@David Mansolino` no idea what caused the crash. I am not sure it's the GPU (Intel¬Æ HD Graphics 4400)

i reset all the world settings and it worked again, there seems to be an issue with webots (for me) when i try to use physics, but it might be the physics dll i use is bugged

`@Chin I`  unfortunately not yet, however you can find generic step-by-step tutorials here: [https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials).

In these tutorials you will learn (amongst other) how to control motors which is what you need for controlling Robotic Arms.

By the way, do you have a specific robotic arm in mind?


`@AntiSquid`, what is your GPU ? Have you been able to identify which OpenGL preference ([https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/preferences#opengl))  cause the crash ?

It shouldn't be a problem. However, it is better to define a boundingObject for the robot. This bounding object usually represents the body of the robot (often the place where the CPU of the robot is) from which the other joints are connected to.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:05:40
Can this be a problem?


Right now I have left it undefined, and instead I have defined the bounding object of all the individual parts of the robot (such as foot, body, etc.)


the robot's boundingobject parameter

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:04:51
Yes.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:04:46
I have another question regarding robot modelling

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:04:36
Thank you.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:04:32
I will do so

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:04:19
Can you open an issue at [https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues](https://github.com/omichel/webots/issues) and describe this bug precisely so that we can try to reproduce it?


Yes, fixing the bug inside Webots.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:03:20
Aside from slightly changing the position of the elevation grid each time, is there any other way to get around this issue?


I see


I also noticed that before making the change, if I change the position of the elevationgrid, then the new elevationgrid with new heights works fine with respect to collision

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:02:44
That is likely a bug...


I see.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:02:10
when some other object e.g. robot collides with the new elevationgrid, the collision seems to still be working with the old version of the elevationgrid


however, collision does not seem to work as desired,


visually the height change can be seen


once activated,


which change the height values


I also have a supervisor with which I change the parameters of the elevation grid

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:00:56
All right.

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 14:00:35
I have an elevationGrid which I have defined and it works fine regarding collisions.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 14:00:07
Hi,

##### nisuunn 05/01/2019 13:59:47
Hi, I have a question regarding elevationGrids.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 06:40:25
Yes, maybe... You are welcome.

##### graduation 05/01/2019 06:40:15
Okay, thank you


May be a setting problem?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 06:38:40
Oops... This version is not any more supported. I would recommend you to upgrade to Webots R2019a revision 1 as we won't fix version 8.5.4 even if you find a memory leak in there.


Is this memory leak specific to a certain simulation?

##### graduation 05/01/2019 06:38:03
Webot version 8.5.4


window10

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 06:37:13
On which OS are you running this?

##### graduation 05/01/2019 06:36:26
But I don't have this problem with the same program on another computer.


Thank you, I will confirm it.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 06:24:31
Did you identify that it is the Webots process that eats up memory? It might be another program, including a Webots controller program.

##### graduation 05/01/2019 06:23:03
Hi, Why does my webot pause the simulation, but the memory used has been rising

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 05/01/2019 06:05:35
Yes, you can export it as VRML97.


Hi,

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 16:03:19
Hi, is there any way to get the world file as a 3D mesh model?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2019 08:29:14
OK.

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:29:04
I will try to use some other collision checking library for collision checking in motion planning.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2019 08:28:29
You are welcome.

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:28:20
Thanks Mr Olivier for clearing my confusion.

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2019 08:26:39
No, that's not possible. Instead you should actually run the simulation possibly with another controller that will be executed before your main controller and that would use run the simulation to perform only collision detection in the physics plug-in.

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:22:16
in fact , the planning part is offline, that is why,  the code for planning is in controller but outside the simulation loop with time\_step. Is it possible to call collision detection  function directly in Controller?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/30/2019 08:08:13
You can probably write a physics plugin in Webots that will send collision information to your robot controller using the Emitter / Receiver system. This information could then be used by OMPL which I guess is linked with your robot controller.


Hi,

##### Ahmad Ali 04/30/2019 08:06:11
Hi,

I am doing motion planning using OMPL (C++ based motion planning library) with Webots. But OMPL does not have its collision checking feature. In Webots, we can check collision using physics plug-in during the simulation. I am wandering if I can use collision checking feature of webots in motion planning (which will be outside the simulation loop).

##### kim 04/30/2019 00:32:54
hello

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 15:23:55
Yep.

##### kim 04/29/2019 15:23:34

We can do it for you if needed.


In that case, it's a standard programming question.

Or the camera of the simulated NAO robot?


Do you mean the camera of the real NAO robot?

##### kim 04/29/2019 15:20:15
can i know how to do?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 15:13:05
Yes.

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:54:47
have you been to use the webcam in webots ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:53:52
Yes.

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:53:41
When I use the kinect also?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:53:05
Instead you can program the simulated NAO robot in Webots directly in Python using the Webots API.


Hence this is why we don't recommend using it.


It is not maintained any more.


The simulator-sdk was basically abandoned by SoftBank, this is why you cannot download it from their official site.


Yes, but it doesn't include the simulator-sdk.

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:49:12
know about this website?


do you knwo?


[https://community.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/resources/software/language/en-gb](https://community.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/resources/software/language/en-gb)


I installed the naoqi in this web site

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:46:45
(basically, it gets installed when you install naoqisim for Webots)


Follow the instructions here: [https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim](https://github.com/omichel/naoqisim)


No, it's free.

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:45:52
do I have to buy?


how do i get the simulator-sdk from SoftBank Robotics?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:43:34
Yes, but that is the native version of naoqi. The simulated version of naoqi relies on the simulator-sdk from SoftBank Robotics.

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:43:02
this code


from naoqi import ALProxy

tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", "<IP of your robot>", 9559)

tts.say("Hello, world!")


so when we control the nao robot in real  we don't use the naoqi ?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 14:41:36
Because SoftBank robotics is not maintaining the naoqi simulator-sdk and there are some bugs and limitation that won't get fixed.


Yes, this is possible but not recommended.

##### kim 04/29/2019 14:40:39

##### Stefania Pedrazzi [cyberbotics] 04/29/2019 08:11:56
`@Ahmad Ali`  it also seems that you are overwriting the "include" variable instead of adding multiple paths. You should use "+=" instead of "="

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/29/2019 08:08:40

`@Ahmad Ali` did you simply tried to add this option in your Makefile?


For C++, you also need a custom Makefile and runtime.ini. There too, please simply refer to a released example.


To use Python and the vehicle library, you need to have a runtime.ini indicating to the controller where to find the vehicle library. You could copy it from any python example using the vehicle library.


`@rittwiq` it would be helpful to have a Matlab wrapper to start simulink. There are maybe other possibilities about to start Simulink directly.

have a nice day üòÑ


Thank you, I'll wait to have a robot to try then

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:57:04
Yes, you certainly need to calibrate it with a real e-puck2 robot.

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:56:30
I think for the lookup table it will be better to set [ -4912 -4912 0.1   4912 4912 0.1 ] that way, when I'll connect a real e-puck the measured values will be the good ones

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:54:52
It's not a value expressed in ¬µT.


However in Webots, the Compass node gives a unit vector which is the direction of the north.


I think so.

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:50:08
so if I do this, it will measure a magnetic field of 4912¬µT in the webots world right?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:43:31
1 4912 0.1 ]


lookupTable [-1 -4912 0.1


Typically, your lookup table may look like this:


They will match what you define in the lookup table.


The 3 output are independent.

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:40:55
So as I need the value to be between -4912 and 4912, will the output be a 3D vector with a fixed length, or the 3 the output are independent?

##### Olivier Michel [cyberbotics] 04/26/2019 13:37:35
Hi, yes setting the lookupTable of the Compass node should be sufficient to calibrate your compass model in that case.

##### Thelm76 04/26/2019 13:34:45
Hi, I'm trying to model a magnetic sensor in webots for e-puck, and I just realized that the output is only a vector whereas the magnetic sensor of e-pucks output a value in ¬µT for each axis. Is a lookup table sufficient to convert the compass into a magnetometer? If not, how can I manage to do this in the proto file?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:31:45
you're welcome. Sharing your approach is a good way to thanks us ^^

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 14:30:50
Thanks!


That sounds like something I was looking for. I will take some time to set this up and if it works I'll share this approach on github.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:27:57
A good approach would be that your main script starts an IPC server, and several instances of Webots on a single world containing a Supervisor listenening as a client on this IPC. The IPC can be a local TCPIP server, this is easy to setup in Python. There are many modules to do similar things. The main script may send events to the supervisor. Mainly it's about to evaluate some fitness, with data (neuron weights or so). In this case, the supervisor may reset the simulation typically by reseting the object position, or reloading the entire world (it's the purpose of a supervisor), and evaluate the fitness, and give the result back to the main script through the IPC.

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 14:19:59
one iteration corresponds to walking until it falls, which is in real time from around 0.5 to 5 seconds


But on a single terrain (world) the learner needs around 1000-5000 iterations.


Python yes. There will be a curriculum in which the terrain on which the robot walk becomes more challenging.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:18:03
and in which language? Python?

later on I will change the world, but for the most iterations it is the same world

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:15:50
... hum just a question: do you need to change the world, or it's just a matter of training a controller in the same world?


A simple approach is the following:

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 14:13:00
Yeah It does, thanks! But how can the main script reload the world and read data from the supervisor controller? I have no experience setting up IPCs. I'll see if anybody else did something similar before, otherwise I'll try to figure out how to do that. Any tips are welcomes üòÉ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 14:03:12
I hope this will help you.


A bit more difficult to setup, but it's more efficient in your case.


to run several Webots slaves "forever", and the main script communicate with them (using any IPC). Webots Supervisor API allows to load another world, reload a world, etc.


To avoid the offset, there is another approach:


A simple test running a simulation sample on multiple instances may give you answers about your CPU load.


Before fearing the offset to run Webots, you could give a try to optimize your simulation üòâ


The CPU/GPU consumption depends a lot on the simulation.

##### El\_Samu\_El 04/25/2019 13:59:16
A single experiment runs in let's say  0.1s in fast forward mode.


Yes this offset is what I am worried about.


I like that idea too, it is just not clear to me how the CPU ressources  are used in this way. And because there would be around 6-12 instances in parallel opening and closing webots GUIs every second.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/25/2019 13:57:07
The main drawback is that launching Webots takes time; this offset may be annoying.


This many advantages, this is very easy to setup.


This is on the responsability of this script to create deal with parallelism.


I like the idea to have a script using Webots as a slave and running one Webots instance per experiment.


Indeed, Webots PRO license doesn't exist anymore, Webots is now free and open-source: this is a good news to run as many Webots instances as you can üòâ

Robot.step((int) Robot.getBasicTimeStep())


It's generally a good idea to let match the controller step rate with WorldInfo.basicTimeStep. In most of my controllers, I'm using this pattern:

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:37:27
üëå

[https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=c++#wb\_robot\_step](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/robot?tab=c++#wb_robot_step)


Yes, it's Robot.step(1) (it's the same function)

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:36:06
I write the controller into C++. Is there still the wb\_robot\_steo() like C?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 14:34:53
.. and your controller should call steps of 1 ms too: wb\_robot\_step(1)


You should apply 1000 steps per second, so you should set WorldInfo.basicTimeStep to 1 (milliseconds). This should work precisely. To be sure, you can get the simulated time in your controller using the wb\_robot\_get\_time() function.

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:30:04
And how can I make the simulation speed is the same as I planned? I planned 10001 datas in 10s. But when I read the planned data and setPosition into the motor. the simulation time is not the same as I planned.

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:23:34

No, I don't define the working mode.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 14:19:11

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 14:18:25
How can I solve it?


If I set it in a positive value, it works right.


motor[1] ->setPosition(-1.0);


when I use c++ api setPosition


I meet this error: WARNING: Robot > DEF RFJoint HingeJoint > Solid > HingeJoint > RotationalMotor: too low requested position: -1 < 0


So I think there are something I do not set it up right


I open some other example project. they can moves in very smoothly.


The realtime speed, the simulation ratio is about 0.90 to 0.98x


Yes, I use the real-time button. And the bacistimestep is 8.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 08:06:05
Do you use the "real-time" button? Could you check that your WorldInfo is set to something reasonable (like 8 or 16 for such robot)? You could also decrease OpenGL preferences, etc. => It's much more convenient to work in real-time and do in order that this is reached (speedometer is constantly reaching 1.0x without fluctuations)

##### Âè§‰∫Ü‰∏™Èπè 04/24/2019 08:03:37

I think it has enough torque. I set the torque into 100

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/24/2019 07:50:26
To be sure of this, you could for example increase the RotationalMotor.maxTorque field: [https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rotationalmotor](https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/rotationalmotor)


Principally, has the motor enough torque (force) to lift its weight?

The simulated time is freezed in between two wb\_robot\_step() calls. Its these calls which let the simulation steps forward of a discrete amount of time.

##### redbagy 04/22/2019 08:49:31
or can I assume that each action takes one time step for example?


like wb\_emitter\_send()


Is there a way to know the time steps taken to execute a command?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/21/2019 18:39:34
So a hopper leg could be modeled as a sequence of rotational/linear motors.


Ok I see. Basically Webots can simulate any robot which is made of a set of solids linked with joints (passive or motorized). To know how to do that, refer to our user guide tutorials. Once done, you could create a controller having access to the dynamics through the sensor API (gyro, inertial unit, etc)

##### Jiajun Wang 04/21/2019 15:33:35
`@Fabien Rohrer`

 I mean a 2D bipedal robot.


`@Fabien Rohrer`

 A planar robot means that the robot\_body's DOF in y, roll & yaw are fixed. such that the robot can only move in the saggittal plane.  

like the Raibert's robot: hopper.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/21/2019 14:36:20
Emitter/receiver can deal with occlusions. It‚Äôs more what you need. But not with reflexion.


`@Akash` distance sensors uses rays but do not ensure communication


`@Jiajun Wang` not sure what you mean by a ¬´¬†planar robot¬†¬ª. A 2 wheeled robots on a planar ground?


It returns the simulated time as a double in seconds.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:29:15
It‚Äôs just something to take into account when you plot the data.


If you choose solution 2. you know that the time between two values are taken is constant.


If you choose solution 1. You should store also the simulated time when you acquire the data.


Both are possible.

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:24:16
i should change to something like that 

static void passive\_wait(double sec) {

  double start\_time = wb\_robot\_get\_time();

  do {

    step();

fprinft(mydata)

  } while (start\_time + sec > wb\_robot\_get\_time());

}

RIGHT?


would it be problem if i use this function as a sleep?

static void passive\_wait(double sec) {

  double start\_time = wb\_robot\_get\_time();

  do {

    step();

  } while (start\_time + sec > wb\_robot\_get\_time());

}


yes thank you

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:22:29
Sounds better like this?


This is what we do in the generic window.


So this is perfect to plot a graph with a regular x-axis (time)


This ensures you that you will have one data every 32 simulated milliseconds. (If WorldInfo.basicTimeStep = 32)


If you create a simple controller, and write a line between each wb\_robot\_step call, this ensures you cannot miss any data.


Haha sorry for this

To be honest now i am lost üòÖ

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:13:38
Not necessarily. It‚Äôs a bad idea IMO, because everything is directly accessible from the controller API.


You should document yourself on the way time is managed in Webots.

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:12:18
So i must change the source of generic robot window to save all sensor data?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:10:39
Yes sure. The Matlab sample is a controller, and the generic robot window uses the controller API only üòâ

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 19:07:49
But i would like to get values of every step. Like in matlab where you get all values after simulation and can plot them. This is what i need. Is it possible from controller?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 19:04:34
When the sensor API is used, it gives you the sensor feedback of the last discrete simulation step.


The controller is by definition at a fixed time between to steps. You can get the simulated time there.

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 18:57:24
The sensor reads data at any given moment right? So is there any easy way to access this container, bulk, field of datas?


Well i want to have data with static time period difrence between each one and in code i have move comand then i wait, then end, after that different command with different wait, pause, sleep  so i am unable to have this period in between.

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 18:50:50
To be honest I still don‚Äôt understand why you cannot store the data from the controller üòÖ

Meanwhile you could solve this by installing Webots from sources


We will create a fix soon


But it seems to be not released: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/src/packaging/files\_msys64.txt](https://github.com/omichel/webots/blob/master/src/packaging/files_msys64.txt)

`@Lukas_` the source code of the generic robot window is in this directory: [https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/resources/projects/plugins/robot\_windows/generic](https://github.com/omichel/webots/tree/master/resources/projects/plugins/robot_windows/generic)

##### el 04/19/2019 17:33:41
libobencv\_imgprog401.dll not found , do you know maybe how can i solve it easily?

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 17:04:39
Yes i understand that but what you suggest is excatly what i dont want, save data at given time. The graph thats is made durring simulation i would like those data used in it. How can i access all of them? Not only data that i can save only at time but like in the graph data from time when sensor is enabled until the end of simulation.  They should be stored somewhere since i can change between time, xy, xz and yz. But how i can access them?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 16:56:10
fprintf allows you to append data to an existing file, therefore to store the history. For example, you could create the file at the begining of the simulation (fprintf(..., ‚Äúw‚Äù)) and then append to this file a line containing the data and the time per step (fprintf(f, ‚Äú%g, %g, %g, %g\n‚Äú, time, v0, v1, v2))

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 16:42:58
well yes but printf fprintf only give me value in current time or after current step() but what if in the end of simulation i want to have all sensor data with TIME\_STEP. Am i missing something? Is this what i ask for possible?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/19/2019 16:39:24
Instead of printf, you could use fprintf to write those values in a file. This file could then be imported in your favorite plotter (pyplot, Matlab, excel, harryplotter, etc. )

##### Lukas\_ 04/19/2019 13:47:30
Hello, I have question. In webots  -> generic robot window -> GPS i can see graph with all values during run. Can I somehow export all those data to external file? I am using C code and have printf for value at given time (step()) but what if i want to access all data as they are in the graph. Can i do it and if so, how?

If I successfully add these sensors I could send you the files if you want

and as I'm beggining with webots, I don't really know which file defines the sensors in the real e-puck

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:16:32
Once added in the E-puck PROTO, you should also add the devices to the communication protocol between the e-puck controller and the real e-puck

but will the sensors added in the proto file be working with a real e-puck?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:13:25
You could directly use DistanceSensor there


Yes, that's another approach.

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:12:56
I have left e-puckDistanceSensor instead of just  DistanceSensor that's right?

##### Fabien Rohrer [Moderator] 04/18/2019 14:12:44
You could open the lookupTable by adding a line in the  E-puckDistanceSensor.proto file:

##### Thelm76 04/18/2019 14:12:19
I think I've found my error


oh


Actually I've just copied one of the other distance sensors and tried to modify it in order to have a different range

Its definition is there: projects/robots/gctronic/e-puck/protos/E-puckDistanceSensor.proto
